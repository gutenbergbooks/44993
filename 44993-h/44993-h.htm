CHAPTER I.
<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">PERILS IN CORSICA.</span>
</h2>

<p>
It is strange that Corsica should be as little
known and visited as it is. Placed within
easy reach of the most unambitious tourist,
offering him the loveliest scenery and few
serious difficulties of travel, it yet remains
comparatively a <i>terra incognita</i>.
</p>

<p>
Many people have a vague idea that its
sole claim to distinction lies in the fact of
its having given birth to the great Napoleon,
and that it is now a land of semi-savagery,
snakes, brigands, and other horrors.
</p>

<p>
There is not a brigand on the island.
</p>

<p>
Snakes exist in some numbers, but the
majority are harmless; and, of those whose
bite is dangerous, there need be no fear on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_2' name='Page_2'>[2]</a></span>
the part of the traveller, as they are in a far
greater hurry to get out of his way, than he
of theirs.
</p>

<p>
As regards the semi-savagery, that is
perhaps a matter of opinion. The Corsican
comes of a race of heroes: he is proud,
conservative, and reticent; phlegmatic until
roused, then dangerous.
</p>

<p>
The lower orders are full of intelligence,
but their domestic surroundings are utterly
bare and unrefined, and the comparative
luxury of our working class is unknown to
and apparently undesired by them. In one
respect the Corsican is certainly uncivilized;
he is, as a rule, quite indifferent to the value
of money, and prefers his own inherent
idleness, or supposed dignity, to any pecuniary
advantage. A gun is generally in his
hand, a spade never; and he will often
starve before he will work, beg, or cheat.
</p>

<p>
Rich lands lie uncultivated, and houses
fall to ruins in Corsica, because the inhabitants
are too lazy to spend a few hours
daily in toil.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, especially coming
from Italy, the land of cheats <span lang="fr_FR"><i>par excellence</i></span>,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_3' name='Page_3'>[3]</a></span>
it is refreshing to be in a country where
there is neither whining beggar, overreaching
landlord, nor humbugging tradesman.
</p>

<p>
A traveller may go from one end of
Corsica to the other, and if he behave
courteously himself, will probably never
meet with a discourteous word, from the
time he sets foot on the island until he
leaves it.
</p>

<p>
At the same time, it cannot be denied
that the Corsicans, though polite and even
friendly to strangers, have a weakness for
shooting one another. It is nonsense to
suppose the vendetta is crushed out; it is as
lively as ever in some parts.
</p>

<p>
The almost inaccessible mountains are
still the resort of escaped bandits (outlaws)&mdash;pursued
by the weak arm of the law&mdash;who,
occasionally bringing down their gend'arme,
are never known to interfere with
a stranger. Their object is not robbery, but
concealment from justice, and the crime for
which it follows them is generally the result
of some private feud.
</p>

<p>
In all this, I speak of the lower orders,
the Corsicans <span lang="fr_FR"><i>purs et simples</i></span>. The upper
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_4' name='Page_4'>[4]</a></span>
classes are not Corsican at all, save in their
love for their country.
</p>

<p>
A Corsican gentleman essays to speak
French like a Parisian, and imitates both
the French manners and character. He is
generally lively and talkative, and has quite
cast away the ignorant apathy of his poorer
brethren regarding the value of money. He
is the advocate of commerce and railways,
and all modern improvements, and dreadfully
ashamed of such barbarous national
customs as the vendetta, generally flatly
denying that such a thing exists at the
present day, and boldly telling you that not
a bandit is now to be found in the mountains.
</p>

<p>
When we expressed our intention of visiting
this unknown land, many were the warning
voices raised to intimidate us by alarmed
friends, and we felt that we were bold women
to stick to our project. One by one, the
terrible prophecies poured in, like so many
shadows of Job's messengers, until the
stoutest heart might have been excused a
quiver.
</p>

<p>
The plague, malaria, sunstroke, serpents,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_5' name='Page_5'>[5]</a></span>
brigands, bugs&mdash;these were a few of the
horrors held out by sensible people, some of
them travellers, for our consideration.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding these reports, however,
we persevered; and the result showed how
much faith is to be given in such cases to
friendly advice.
</p>

<p>
Each of the threatened perils turned out,
more or less, nothing but a phantom.
</p>

<p>
The truth of the matter is, that Corsica
is a remarkably easy country in which to
travel, totally without difficulties or dangers
of any sort, to the person who is only careful
to select a good coachman as his pioneer.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, the accommodation is
often extremely rough, and it is by no
means the place for an invalid or a
fastidious person.
</p>

<p>
The cooking is nearly always good, and
the dinners excellent; but the village inns
are sometimes filthy, and the bedrooms
horrible. There is only one good hotel&mdash;really
excellent&mdash;in the whole island, and
that is at Ajaccio; and people who travel
in Corsica must be prepared, not only for
broken windows, sour bread, and no butter,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_6' name='Page_6'>[6]</a></span>
but for bad smells, black floors, and a total
absence of all the decencies of life. They
will also occasionally find an army of black
beetles in their rooms, and sometimes
something worse.
</p>

<p>
Sundry and manifold remedies we tried
against this last and most terrible plague;
but all in vain.
</p>

<p>
One friend, a consul, counselled the use
of carbolic soap, and we accordingly each
invested in a slab of this not over inviting
article, submitting ourselves to a scent like
that of puppy dogs on washing day. But
the enemy didn't mind it in the least.
</p>

<p>
Another, military, friend believed strongly
in Keating's powder, and informed me how,
one night in Poland, upon a threatened
attack of vermin, he had put it to a severe
test. He had thrown up an earthwork of
Keating in a ring round the bed, reposing
within peacefully unmolested until morning.
The enemy had stormed the bastion,
but failed to make a breach, being repulsed
with heavy loss; and, when day broke,
retired discomfited and utterly routed,
leaving their dead upon the plain. But
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_7' name='Page_7'>[7]</a></span>
clearly the Polish bug has not the indomitable
energy and insular enterprise of his
Corsican relative. Our carefully prepared
entrenchments were utterly futile; and the
foe, when present, speedily gained possession
of the battle-field, causing ignominious
flight. But in many instances, where the
village inn looked of the poorest and lowest,
our anticipations, in respect of uncleanliness,
were agreeably disappointed.
</p>

<p>
Our party, when at last it started for
the island, consisted of three unprotected
ladies, whom, for the sake of distinction,
we will call Nos. 1, 2, and 3.
</p>

<p>
It was towards the end of April when we
left Leghorn for Bastia, and not a propitious
day. All night long a high gale had been
blowing, and the lightning dancing across
a black sky; and when, at about 8 a.m.,
we left the quay in our little boat, the wind
had not moderated much, and even in the
harbour the waves tossed us up and down
in a most lively manner. When we reached
the steamer, we saw that she was a most
wretched little concern, laden with merchandise,
and of no beam at all; whilst
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_8' name='Page_8'>[8]</a></span>
the open sea beyond was covered with high
white breakers.
</p>

<p>
I think our hearts would have failed us,
and we should have turned back, notwithstanding
the good augury of a Sunday
morning, had it not been for the tedious
term of delay circumstances had already
imposed upon us at Leghorn and at
Florence. We felt that if we did not go
by this boat, we might never go: the
season was already late for Corsica: so we
shut our eyes, and went.
</p>

<p>
For nearly three quarters of an hour that
horrid little knife-shaped steamer rose and
sank on the heavy swell inside the harbour;
and then, at length, when every one was
beginning to look pale, she heaved up her
anchors and departed on her way. And
what a way it was!
</p>

<p>
There were but few passengers on board
beside ourselves, and no ladies. The others
consisted of half a dozen French and
Corsican gentlemen, one of whom, a stout,
middle-aged individual, returning to his
native land after a thirty years' absence in
France, took a special interest in the three
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_9' name='Page_9'>[9]</a></span>
adventurous English ladies, who could
brave such a sea for its dear sake. This
person, watching our failing powers, offered
us much kindly sympathy and well-meant
advice, received, I fear, with the amount
of ingratitude usual on such occasions.
</p>

<p>
For eight long hours we tossed, and
rolled, and danced about on the bosom of
that heartless sea. It was really bad
weather, and the waves washed clean over
the rickety little vessel. I lay vaguely
wondering whether we should share the
fate of a large Indian steamer, which the
very day before had been wrecked in this
sea, on the Elba rocks, on its way to
Bombay. Starting from Leghorn at 5 a.m.,
at seven o'clock she struck upon the rocks,
and before an hour was over the fine vessel
was not only a total wreck, but almost
entirely submerged. Fortunately, a fleet of
fishing-boats in the neighbourhood rescued
the crew, and passengers, who, after an
unenviable cruise of seven or eight hours,
and with the loss of all their baggage, found
themselves relanded at Leghorn, where
some of them came to our hotel and detailed
their misfortunes.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_10' name='Page_10'>[10]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
But over those eight hours I draw a veil.
I would only caution any intending visitor
to Corsica, who may not be a good sailor
and a tough traveller, not to be misled by
any popular delusions as to the "calm blue
waters of the Mediterranean," but to be
careful as to the boat and day he selects
for his voyage. Also, to make sure that
the boat marked in his time-table does
really go at the hour specified, or indeed
at all that day, which is by no means to be
taken for granted.

CHAPTER II.
<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">THE TOWN OF BASTIA.</span>
</h2>

<p>
Soon after four o'clock, our small vessel
laboured its way into Bastia harbour, and
a crowd of little boats came alongside to
convey us and our effects to shore. I
looked down, and saw the most wonderful
sea, a deep Prussian blue, tossing against
the steamer's sides; looked above, and saw
a long, level shore, backed by low hills, the
large town of Bastia rising gently from the
water's edge, with complex streets and
tall, factory-like houses. In a few minutes
we were landed on Corsican soil; and,
whilst our things lay before the door of
the custom house just opposite the landing-stage,
they became the cause of a lively
altercation between the many female porters
anxious to appropriate them as far as the
hotel. We were the centre of an admiring,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_12' name='Page_12'>[12]</a></span>
or curious, crowd of about a hundred
natives; and amongst these, twenty or
thirty tall, stalwart women and a few boys
pushed, and jostled, and fought over our
possessions, with an intense determination
good to see. The men, meanwhile, Corsican
fashion, stood by, silent and dignified, their
hands in their pockets, looking on indifferently
at the struggles of their better halves.
When at length we were ready to start,
and the three trunks had been replaced on
the hand-cart, we had to pursue and divest
five women of our small handbags, sketching
blocks, and bundles of wraps, with which,
deprived of the trunks, they were separately
consoling themselves, deciding, to their
mortification, that it did not require that
number of stout females, in addition to a
strong cart, to carry our very moderate
allowance of luggage. Three of them,
nevertheless, followed us to the hotel door,
where, placing the heavy boxes on their
heads, they marched with stately steps up
the dark and dingy staircase, and deposited
them in our rooms.
</p>

<p>
It is astonishing what weight Corsican
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_13' name='Page_13'>[13]</a></span>
women can bear upon their heads. From
childhood upwards, they are accustomed to
carry all the heavy domestic burdens, and
to carry them on their heads. They will
pile one thing on the top of another, until,
in the distance, they look like an advancing
phantom of monstrous form. Enormous
piles of wood, two or three yards long, large
baskets full of heavy family goods, great
wooden or earthenware cans and jars full
of water, with sometimes a baby on the
arm, are their usual burdens. Nothing but
a baby is ever carried on the arm; and so
much more convenient has habit made it
to them to use their heads rather than their
hands, that I believe, if the baby could be
induced to keep its equilibrium as surely as
the can of water or the load of wood, it
would long ago have been transferred likewise
to that elevation. Here is a specimen
of a woman, who, with a remarkably strong
and plunging infant on her arm, and a very
large jar balanced sideways on her head,
remained placidly motionless for at least
ten minutes before us at the village of
Buchisano, to have her portrait taken.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_14' name='Page_14'>[14]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The men of Corsica never carry anything
except a gun or a heavily-knobbed stick; in
fact, they rarely carry themselves, as they
are generally on mule or donkey back; and
it is no unusual sight to meet one or two
of the nobler sex jogging along, pipe in
mouth, on their mules, whilst the women
of the family trudge behind, bearing babe
and burden.
</p>

<p>
The Corsican women are much more
lively than their helpmeets; they have less
of dignity and a vast deal more energy.
They can appreciate a joke, which, as a
rule, the men apparently cannot.
</p>

<p>
I should imagine that a woman is never,
or hardly ever, ill-treated in Corsica. She is
too useful, and the men of the family too
apathetic; but, undoubtedly, she is looked
upon as an inferior animal by the other
sex.
</p>

<p>
<span lang="fr_FR">"Les femmes sont si ignorantes,"</span> as a
man said to me, with good-natured contempt;
and certainly they cannot discuss
the politics and resources of their country
with the glib intelligence displayed by
nearly all the men; but the country would
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_15' name='Page_15'>[15]</a></span>
be in a queer condition without their
industry and energy.
</p>

<p>
The men mostly slouch a good deal, the
result of a lazy, useless life, spent in
wanderings up and down the village street,
and ceaseless gossip, varied by an occasional
expedition with their guns into the country;
but the women have a fine upright carriage,
owing to their long habitude of balancing
heavy articles upon their heads.
</p>

<p>
The dress of the men at Bastia, and
indeed all over Corsica, differs little from
that of the English working classes, and
generally consists of brown fustian or black
velveteen. The only variety is caused by
the wide-awake hat, the high boots, and the
invariable strap across the shoulder supporting
the large yellow gourd, which, hanging
at their side, contains their wine.
</p>

<p>
The women dress very quietly, nearly
always in black or white, or some equally
sober shade. They wear a skirt and jacket
of different materials, with a large white or
black handkerchief tied under the chin.
This handkerchief, when pulled well forward,
is a good protection against the sun;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_16' name='Page_16'>[16]</a></span>
but, in the heat of summer, most of them
perch upon it an enormous low-crowned,
flat-brimmed, white straw hat, as big as an
ordinary parasol, which, as it bears no
trimming whatever, is somewhat trying
even to a good-looking face.
</p>

<p>
You never see a Corsican woman's hair,
which is a pity, as there is reason to believe
it is often pretty and luxuriant.
</p>

<p>
Every Corsican carries a huge cotton
umbrella&mdash;red, green, or brilliant blue&mdash;both
for the heavy rains and for protection from
the sun.
</p>

<p>
Our first view of the Hotel de France
somewhat appalled us. The street in which
it is situated is a fine one&mdash;the finest in
Corsica&mdash;wide and full of handsome houses;
but the entrance to the hotel was mean and
dark, and the outside decidedly dirty.
</p>

<p>
The first hotel in Corsica, after leaving
luxurious Italy, is certainly a shock to a
sensitive mind; and that at Bastia does not
let you down gently. The food is good
and abundant, the charges very reasonable,
and the people exceedingly good-natured;
but the stone hall and narrow staircase are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_17' name='Page_17'>[17]</a></span>
unswept, the bedrooms dingy, and the floors
and walls not above suspicion.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, the Hotel de France is the
best in Bastia; and, although we did not
find it clean, we probably should have found
the other hotels (of which there are several)
a good deal dirtier.
</p>

<p>
Our fat friend, who had established himself
as our guide and protector through the
custom house and streets, and who had
given his arm to one of our party who was
in a shaky condition, owing to the voyage,
now left us in the hotel hall, bidding us
farewell till dinner time, and commending
us to the care of M. Stauffe.
</p>

<p>
It was an amusing table d'hôte at six
o'clock. There were about eighteen or
twenty gentlemen, all Corsicans, we being
the only representatives of our sex. All
were exceedingly lively, our stout friend
especially being the centre of much repartee
and rapid argument.
</p>

<p>
As usual in Corsica, the conversation,
carried on in very good French, was almost
exclusively devoted to political questions,
which were discussed very freely, and with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_18' name='Page_18'>[18]</a></span>
so much animation that now and then hot
words seemed imminent; but they always
passed away in a joke.
</p>

<p>
Our friend, after living so long abroad,
found his opinions rather too cosmopolitan
for his neighbours, and they hammered
away at each other with an amazing freedom
and familiarity.
</p>

<p>
But the old fellow continued to take
a great interest in us, interspersing his
political talk with polite remarks across the
table, and recommending to us in turn
nearly every dish. If we seemed to approve
of any of these, he became quite excited,
nodding his head with many smiles, and
remarking in a satisfied tone, <span lang="fr_FR">"Bon, bon,
bon!"</span>
</p>

<p>
This was repeated so often, being only
diversified by an occasional <span lang="fr_FR">"Bien, bien,
bien!"</span> that it was quite impossible to resist
laughing, which at length we all did, including
himself.
</p>

<p>
<span lang="fr_FR">"Mais avouez, mademoiselle,"</span> he remarked
to No. 3, <span lang="fr_FR">"qu'il y a de beaux plats
dans la Corse."</span>
</p>

<p>
<span lang="fr_FR">"Sans doute,"</span> she replied, politely; "and
many other beautiful things, I believe."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_19' name='Page_19'>[19]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
<span lang="fr_FR">"Mais oui!"</span> he returned, smiling. <span lang="fr_FR">"Un
beaux pays. Et,"</span> with a sudden happy
thought, turning towards a good-looking
young man seated next him, and who did
not attempt to disclaim the compliment,
<span lang="fr_FR">"de beaux garçons! Blonds, comme lui.
Et noirs&mdash;comme moi!"</span>
</p>

<p>
The fair young man turned upon him
quite fiercely. "<i>You</i> a garçon?" he asked.
"How old are you? <i>I</i> am twenty-four."
</p>

<p>
"And I forty-seven&mdash;<span lang="fr_FR">un bel âge!"</span>
</p>

<p>
His neighbour pulled his long yellow
moustaches with a scornful laugh.
</p>

<p>
"You are an old man&mdash;voilà!" said he,
curtly.
</p>

<p>
The wind that night at Bastia was remarkable.
This part of the coast is noted
for its constant and varying gales. Whether
this particular wind were the "Sirocco," or
the "Grecale," or the "Libecchio," or any
other of the various currents which afflict
this town, I know not; but it was a most
unpleasant wind, and one that seemed
especially weird in the darkness of night.
</p>

<p>
My bedroom was a thorough Corsican
room; not a bolt nor a lock fastened
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_20' name='Page_20'>[20]</a></span>
properly, and doors and windows were
confidingly open to every sound within
doors, and every breeze without.
</p>

<p>
Chimneys and roofs constituted the chief
look-out, but my view likewise comprised,
between the two high towers of the church
of St. Jaen, a small stretch of blue black
sea, lying heaving angrily in the fitful
moonlight, with now and then a gleam of
sheet lightning illuminating its dark bosom.
</p>

<p>
Wonderfully still and soundless was the
night air, until suddenly, every quarter of
an hour or so, came a wild gust that rattled
loose slates outside, and shook the doors
and windows as if they were wrested by
some violent human hand. This sort of
thing, repeated all night long at short
intervals, and accompanied by a dismal
howling like the wails of lost souls in
purgatory, is not exactly conducive to
repose; and my first night on Corsican soil
was spent in pondering over insular phenomena,
and speculating how many would
be of an equally disturbing nature.
</p>

<p>
We spent several days in Bastia, during
which time, either the sirocco, or one of its
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_21' name='Page_21'>[21]</a></span>
family, continued to blow with unabated
vigour; and, as I found an equally squally
wind in possession on my return many
weeks later, I concluded that this sort of
thing had been going on all the time. For
which reason alone, if for no other, I infer
that Bastia is not a desirable place for a
prolonged residence.
</p>

<p>
It does not take very long to explore the
town. It is a rather compact place of about
eighteen thousand inhabitants, curiously
built, as are most Corsican towns, running
up the side of a hill, with one large main
street, joined to the lesser ones by flights
of steps, or more often by steep stony
ascents.
</p>

<p>
The houses are perfect factories for height
and baldness of architecture, being, however,
a shade cleaner and less repulsive-looking
than in any other Corsican town,
except perhaps Ajaccio. Seven stories is
the usual height; some of the houses having
windows closely barred and wired (the
remains perhaps of the outward symbols of
a vendetta in higher life than is now the
fashion). It is the only town in the island,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_22' name='Page_22'>[22]</a></span>
except Ajaccio, which really has any shops
to speak of; but they are rather difficult
for an English person to find, as comparatively
few of them have "shop windows,"
and you have to peer in through dark,
dingy doorways, to perceive the wares sold
within. It took us nearly half an hour to
find the photographer, and a long walk up
steps, and down steps, and through gardens,
among which an occasional guiding placard
encouraged our wearying search. But, on
the other hand, I found quite an ornamental
straw hat, trimmed with blue wool, was to
be bought for the modest sum of fivepence
halfpenny in the high street!
</p>

<p>
Judging from their shops, the people of
Bastia must be uncommonly fond of sweets.
The streets are pretty equally divided
between the <span lang="fr_FR">"patisserie"</span> and <span lang="fr_FR">"confisserie"</span>
shops, and the coiffeurs, with here and
there a jeweller's window. But the best
jewellery shops (and they are not much to
speak of) are in the Rue St. Jaen, behind
the church; and here, as in duty bound,
we invested in little yellow gourds and
silver-mounted daggers. These daggers&mdash;the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_23' name='Page_23'>[23]</a></span>
smaller ones made of coral, ebony, or
silver, in silver sheaths, and the larger ones
of metal&mdash;are inscribed with the fatal words,
"Vendetta," or "La mort," and are very
thrilling to a stranger. But the thrill cools
somewhat when one learns, as we did later
on, that whatever may have been the fashion
in olden times, the dagger is now comparatively
unknown to the Corsicans, and
its use confined to the Italian and "Continentale."
Probably, in the days when the
vendetta was the fashion amongst the upper
classes, the dagger was its usual instrument
of vengeance; but now that murdering is
banished in great part to the lower ranks,
guns and pistols have almost entirely taken
its place.
</p>

<p>
The Hotel de Ville at Bastia, with its
high flight of steps, and containing some
specimens of native marble, is considered
a fine building; but to eyes fresh from
Florence, the land of enchanted palaces,
there was not much to admire about it.
</p>

<p>
The same may be said of the church of
St. Jaen. Its two high towers were imposing
at a distance, but otherwise the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_24' name='Page_24'>[24]</a></span>
exterior was commonplace. Inside were
some large Norman arches of white marble;
and the different altars were surrounded by
balustrades and pavements of local marbles&mdash;green,
and red, and variegated&mdash;curious,
but not nearly so beautiful as the Italian
marbles. The six or seven wide steps up
to the church door were covered by groups
of picturesque, barefooted, dirty little
children, who roamed unchecked in and
out of the building, laughing and chatting,
and occasionally enjoying a game of hide-and-seek
behind the pillars. Some black-robed
women, and a man with tin-tacks in
his mouth, were busy arranging a large
figure of the Madonna on a pedestal within
the altar-rail, in front of the principal altar.
</p>

<p>
This position of dignity was no doubt
owing to the approaching month of May,
or "month of Mary;" but also partly, as
a good woman informed us in a whisper,
because of the present severe affliction of
bad weather under which the country was
suffering. The prayers of Mary, besieged
as her ear would be, in this position, night
and day by the petitions of believers, would,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_25' name='Page_25'>[25]</a></span>
it was hoped, effect a mitigation of the evil.
The image was of china, life size, highly
coloured, with golden crown, pink cheeks,
and blue robe, and was placed upon a
pedestal about five feet high, from the sides
of which sprung a large arch of white roses
and gold tinsel, which completely encircled
the Madonna. This pedestal was being
covered by the devotees, who bowed the
knee each time on passing the image, with
coloured stuffs and white lace, and bedecked
with many brass candlesticks and
vases of artificial flowers. It struck me as
a singular fact, that in a country so grandly
prolific of beautiful flowers as Corsica, the
artificial should be preferred to the real.
</p>

<p>
Continuing our walk through the curious,
narrow, stony streets, where in one place
we had to run the gauntlet of a large
bonfire in a very small byeway, over which
the Bastia urchins, with bare legs, leaped
to an inspiring tune of their own chanting,
we arrived at the bastion walls. They are
high and picturesque, but not to be compared
with those of Calvi or Bonifacio.
</p>

<p>
Here, also, we came upon a market with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_26' name='Page_26'>[26]</a></span>
uncommonly dear oranges, and with gay
stuffs ranged upon open carts or stalls for
peasant purchase.
</p>

<p>
The best looking end of the town is near
the landing-stage. A fine quay stretches
out for some distance, and there is a good
harbour, generally floating one or two fine
steamers from Africa or Marseilles. There
is also, of course, a statue of Napoleon on
the place in front of the quay, and here the
soldiers, in their gay uniforms of blue and
red, drill unceasingly, and daily parade the
town twice to the oft-repeated tune of their
particular local march.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_27' name='Page_27'>[27]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
CHAPTER III.
<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">THE GROTTO OF BRANDO.</span>
</h2>

<p>
Notwithstanding the cold wind and the
uncertain weather, we could not leave
Bastia without an expedition in the Cap
Corse direction. Cap Corse is the northern
peninsula of Corsica, stretching out into
the Mediterranean for many miles, like a
long tongue. At its extremity are fine
rocks and one or two lighthouses, but
these we were fated not to see.
</p>

<p>
We started from the hotel in good time,
leaving behind No. 1, who preferred the
quaintness of the Bastia architecture, and
wished to sketch in the streets.
</p>

<p>
Our equipage was a little open carriage,
drawn by a pair of lively chestnut ponies
that went like the wind; and we were
further escorted by "Bigemark"&mdash;a black
and tan quadruped apparently belonging to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_28' name='Page_28'>[28]</a></span>
the pointer breed, intelligent and affectionate,
but not endowed with the fatal gift
of beauty, and possessed of barely a remnant
either of ears or tail. Our first object was
to see the Caves of Brando, wonderful
grottos of limestone formation, in the hillside
close by the seashore, about seven
miles from Bastia.
</p>

<p>
The road to Brando was charming, following
the shore the whole way, about a
dozen yards above the sea level; the slope
downwards being clothed with splendid
cacti, and with groves of olive, orange,
cherry, walnut, and fig trees, with here and
there an ilex. Out of the forests, the two
common trees of Corsica are the olive and
the ilex; and beautifully they harmonize
together, the rich shining green of the ilex
contrasting effectively with the silver grey
of the olive.
</p>

<p>
The forest trees consist chiefly of pines,
firs, and beeches, varied by a few oaks and
cedars; and the chestnut woods generally
stand alone.
</p>

<p>
Bordering the slope, and amongst the
olives, bloomed flowers of every description
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_29' name='Page_29'>[29]</a></span>
and colour; whilst great grasses, pale pink
asphodel, and giant golden spurge, grew
like young trees among the rocks, and all
along the roadside the weird prickly pear
raised its ghostly arms in a huge hedge.
</p>

<p>
Beyond this, almost from beneath our
feet, stretched far away the wide sweep of
Mediterranean, sparkling with countless
flashes, and bearing on its laughing bosom
the islands of Capraya, Elba, and Monte
Christo. Monte Christo was but a blue
cone above the waters; and Capraya,
though larger, was cloudy and mysterious;
but Elba lay before us majestically grand
in the dappled sunlight, precipitous walls
of barren rock and smiling hillside standing
out in a fine contrast.
</p>

<p>
On the other side of the road, and rising
steeply up, were rocky hills, well clothed
with the sweet-smelling macchie; whilst,
between every rocky rift, showed glimpses
of wilder mountains, the inland chain of
Corsica, raising their grey heads from misty
veils of morning.
</p>

<p>
Macchie, in Corsica, is a word that means
much. It is, literally, scrub or undergrowth;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_30' name='Page_30'>[30]</a></span>
but it is, practically, one of the
most perfect garments ever woven by
nature. It may be thick or thin, but is
generally composed of a dense mass of
shrubs, from two to four feet high, massed
over and carpeted under by the richest and
most luxuriant flowers.
</p>

<p>
The pink and the white cystus, the
common weed of Corsica, which covers
miles of country with its red or snow-white
bushes on their sturdy growth, is the usual
foundation of the macchie; but mingled
with it are a score of other low growing
plants, of various and often aromatic scents.
</p>

<p>
Here, by the Bastia road, where the hills
sloped gently up from the road, the macchie
grew closely; but where the grey and
green and red rocks rose more steeply, the
plants could only hang in the crevices overhead&mdash;here
a cystus, and there a purple
thistle, with the little crimson cyclamen
peeping out of every cranny, and the bright
lizards darting across the sunny stones.
</p>

<p>
Very beautiful was this first view of the
Corsican rocks, and of the wide sea panorama
of historic islands, each telling in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_31' name='Page_31'>[31]</a></span>
silent grandeur its own history of adventure,
heroism, or the stern freaks of
fortune. The very name of Monte Christo
seemed to launch one into dim dreams of
wild peril and desperate attempt; whilst
the dark cliffs of Elba frowned in a stern
harmony to their tale of the despotic
emperor, whose heart for a time beat in
impotent resistance against its prison walls.
</p>

<p>
What a satire it seemed, to place that
proud, all-conquering Corsican on an island
from whose heights he could plainly see the
rugged mountains of his native land&mdash;almost
smell the sweet odours of the macchie-covered
hills, wafted across his childhood's
sea, from her to him!
</p>

<p>
At last, in a blue bay where little breakers
dashed merrily, the red ponies were suddenly
reined up. Bigemark came to the
carriage door to offer his congratulations,
and our taciturn coachman informed us we
were at Brando. At the same time he
obligingly pointed out to us, up the side
of the steep hill, a stony watercourse, down
which ran a lively little stream, and which,
he told us, was the "path" to the grotto.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_32' name='Page_32'>[32]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Up this we accordingly went, with one
hand keeping a desperate clutch on our
straw hats (which evinced a strong disposition
to obey the invitation of the sirocco,
and fly away for a nearer view of Capraya),
and, with the other, rescuing what garments
we could from the running stream.
</p>

<p>
About half-way up the hill we were met
by an aged but lively crone, who with
another woman escorted us to the caves,
informing us, as we supposed (for it was
quite impossible to understand her toothless
jumble of bad French and Italian patois),
that she was the custodian of the place.
The grottos belong to a private family, of
the name of Ferdinandi, who have made the
winding staircases, and whose name, on the
stone slab fixed in the rock outside, is
appended to the intimation that this their
work is devoted to the enjoyment of all
lovers of beauty.
</p>

<p>
Leading us by the hand, and laughing
much at our evident want of comprehension
of all the interesting facts with which she
was beguiling the short way, our cavern
crone opened a little wooden door in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_33' name='Page_33'>[33]</a></span>
face of the cliff, and ushered us straight
into a Gothic-roofed hall of limestone, the
reception room in this winding gallery of
nature's building. Here we were told (by
gesture) to remain until our guides returned.
We accordingly sat down on a block of
limestone, which constituted the one chair
in this chilly, half-stuffy hall, semi-darkness
revealing the grey white walls and roof, and
the rude staircase up which had gone our
two companions to light up the many
hanging lamps necessary to illuminate the
caves.
</p>

<p>
In about ten minutes they returned, and
we then proceeded up the same staircase,
cut roughly out of the rock, into the heart
of the cliff. Overhead hung countless
glittering stalactites, whilst on each side
the most fantastic walls enclosed us, the
dim rays of the oil lamps throwing open
tracery and arched roof into weirdest
shadows and gleams of sparry radiance.
</p>

<p>
Here and there the path was broken, and
in some places we had to bow humbly
beneath the drooping arch; sometimes up,
and sometimes down, we went on in this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_34' name='Page_34'>[34]</a></span>
airy labyrinth for about ten minutes before
we turned and came back by another path.
The limestone formations probably extend
much further into the cliff; but the winding
pathway goes no further, and one can only
be thankful that Corsican energy has effected
so much. The forms of some of the stalagmites
were most curious, rising like Alpine
ranges, with an infinity of Matterhorns,
above many a little hollowed nook, or like
the carved screen behind some marble altar;
some so delicate in tracery and so transparent
that a light, held behind them, lit
them up like finely veined cream-coloured
glass; whilst the stalactites overhead were
countless and most graceful, often passing
below their stalagmitic brethren and falling
between them in a rich confusion of spiral
carving.
</p>

<p>
What a glare it seemed when we emerged
again from fairyland, out among the arbutus
and the foxgloves on the green hillside,
overlooking the dazzling sea!
</p>

<p>
The old woman was merrier than ever
after her short incarceration in Mother
Earth, and held out her capacious apron to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_35' name='Page_35'>[35]</a></span>
receive our fees; sending after us many
good wishes, which I have no doubt were
as sincere as her witticisms were pungent,
but which unfortunately were quite lost
upon us.
</p>

<p>
The stipulated sum to see the caves of
Brando is a franc and a half each person. It
seems a good deal at first; but the visitors
are no doubt few, and the expense of so
many lights rather heavy.
</p>

<p>
In a minute or two more, we and the
red ponies and Bigemark were off again,
trotting on to the marina, or little sea
hamlet of Sisco. A mile or two past
Brando, we came in sight of Erbalunga,
a most picturesque little village lying on
a low tongue of land right out into the
Mediterranean, a Genoese round tower at
its furthest end, standing on black rocks
washed incessantly by the breaking waves.
</p>

<p>
Towards one o'clock we reached our
baiting place, a seashore village which
appeared to consist of one house, namely,
the dirty and unpretentious inn before
which we stopped. Since leaving Brando,
the road had become sterner, the rocks
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_36' name='Page_36'>[36]</a></span>
barer, and the flowers more scanty; the
green groves disappearing from the waterside,
and being replaced by great blocks of
granite and porphyry.
</p>

<p>
Feeling a little doubtful as regarded
lunch, we entered the inn door, and picking
our way across the very dirty floor of
the outer room, in which were assembled
some half dozen or so of peasant men and
women, with the usual accompaniment of
dogs and guns, we were shown by the host
into an inner apartment, and supplied with
two rickety chairs.
</p>

<p>
The floor of this apartment was not much
cleaner than the other, and a bedstead
lately in use filled one end of it. But a
capital smell of cooking came from the
kitchen on the other side, and through
the grimy little window gleamed the bluest
sweep of sea and sky. After some conversation
with our host, a hairy, black bearded
man of polite and sociable proclivities,
smoking a short pipe, we discovered that
the culinary resources of the establishment
consisted of an omelette. But, sniffing
again incredulously, and stating our conviction
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_37' name='Page_37'>[37]</a></span>
that something better was secreted
in the little kitchen, after some hesitation,
a soup tureen, containing the most savoury
smelling soup, was brought to us.
</p>

<p>
"Look here, mesdames," said the landlord
confidentially, "I have two more
ladies upstairs, lodging here; young ladies,
whose home is in the Cap, and this is their
soup. But, if you will not take too much,
you shall have some. The ladies have also
my best room, or you would not have had
to put up with this poor apartment."
</p>

<p>
Whilst making his polite speeches, and
they were many, our host constantly half
raised his fur cap from his bushy hair;
but he continued to smoke his short black
pipe.
</p>

<p>
Whilst we were eating our soup, he drew
a chair up to the table, and continued the
conversation.
</p>

<p>
"You are Continentales, ladies, are you
not? Are you Frenchwomen?"
</p>

<p>
"No, monsieur, we are English," we
replied, feeling gently flattered by the compliment
to the purity of our French accent.
</p>

<p>
It was not until some time later that I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_38' name='Page_38'>[38]</a></span>
discovered that the Corsican lower orders,
although often speaking the French tongue
tolerably fluently, yet were not very correct
judges of the French accent. And I confess
my vanity received a shock when a young
Corsican gentleman at Corte, who had
travelled a good deal and lived some time
in Paris, remarked, almost before I had
opened my mouth, "You are English,
I perceive, mademoiselle? One discovers
that at once by your accent!"
</p>

<p>
This gentleman was very agreeable, and
gave me some interesting information about
his country; but, from his opening speech,
I could have told <i>him</i>, however good his
accent, that <i>he</i> was not a Frenchman.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" said the landlord, thoughtfully,
"English, to be sure. They travel a great
deal, for they are all rich, as rich as possible."
</p>

<p>
"No," said I; "some of them are very
poor." Whereat our black friend laughed
incredulously.
</p>

<p>
It is simply impossible to convince any
uneducated Corsican that England is not
a nation composed exclusively of millionaires.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_39' name='Page_39'>[39]</a></span>
He thinks every English person has
his pocket full of gold.
</p>

<p>
England, although well known to them
all by name, is to them a sort of Ultima
Thule; and the mere fact of a journey
taken from such a distance for purposes of
pleasure, seems to them conclusive upon
the point. "How can you say you are not
wealthy when you have come all this way
to amuse yourselves?" was frequently said
to us in a tone of conviction.
</p>

<p>
This being the popular notion, it is much
to the credit of the people, and a proof of
the national simplicity and honesty, that
imposition and overcharging to strangers is
almost unknown.
</p>

<p>
A little stir outside now attracted the
attention of the landlord, and he left us to
finish our lunch alone. This appeared to
me a favourable opportunity for depriving
the Cap Corse young ladies of a little more
of their good soup, and I was just going to
help myself to a second basinful when the
old woman who had spread the table for
us, and who no doubt had suspected my
felonious intentions, entered from the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_40' name='Page_40'>[40]</a></span>
kitchen and abruptly bore off the tureen
upstairs.
</p>

<p>
So I had to content myself with munching
some sour bread, which my companion
was already sharing with a happy family
gathered around, consisting of three cats,
a dog, two pigeons, and a hen. They did
not seem to share our objections to the
bread which we found difficult to swallow,
even when soaked in the good red wine
upon the table.
</p>

<p>
The peninsula of Cap Corse is celebrated
for its red and white wines, which even in
the sixteenth century, we are told by the
native historian Fillipini, were exported to
the Continent and much thought of.
</p>

<p>
In some particulars, this northern district
of Cap Corse bears a stamp of its own, apart
from the customary Corsican character. It
is one of the most fertile districts in the
island. Oranges and lemons, and the fruit
called the cédrat, which is neither orange
nor lemon, but something between the
two, and is much preserved, grow here
luxuriantly; whilst vineyards flourish in
every direction.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_41' name='Page_41'>[41]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The valleys all along the coast, and
especially the Vale of Luri, are green and
cultivated; and the population is thicker
and more well-to-do than in the other
parts of the island. The land certainly
is rich and peculiarly friendly to the
growth of vines, but the secret perhaps
lies in the superior energy of the Cap
Corse people.
</p>

<p>
For several centuries they have manifested
an industry truly unpatriotic, and a
corresponding neglect of warlike pursuits.
Among the gentler inhabitants of this
district it was, too, that Christianity found
its first converts on the island, from them
gradually spreading to the sterner tribes
southward; and tradition asserts that St.
Paul, amongst his many perils by sea,
braved the dangers of this rocky coast, and
landed somewhere on Cap Corse as its first
missionary.
</p>

<p>
Sisco also, Gregorovius tells us, possesses
a marine church dedicated to St. Catherine,
and containing some very remarkable relics,
such as the rod with which Moses smote
the Red Sea, almonds from the garden of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_42' name='Page_42'>[42]</a></span>
Eden, and even a piece of the lump of earth
from which Adam was modelled!
</p>

<p>
I saw no church in or near Sisco during
my short stay there; but, had I then been
aware of the reputed possession of these
treasures, I should certainly have made
some efforts to discover its whereabouts.
</p>

<p>
We were still struggling with the sour
bread when the landlord re-entered. He
had rather a triumphant smile upon his
countenance, as he remarked quietly, "You
cannot go back to Bastia; you must
stay here. Your carriage is all broken to
pieces."
</p>

<p>
"That is unfortunate," said we; "but we
could not stop here, quand même; we could
walk back to Bastia, it is not ten miles."
And, leaving the happy family, we walked
outside to see the truth of the assertion.
</p>

<p>
A little crowd of about a dozen people,
constituting, I fancy, all the population of
the village of Sisco, had gathered round the
inn, watching the course of events with a
sort of phlegmatic interest.
</p>

<p>
Our carriage was gone from its original
position in the middle of the road, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_43' name='Page_43'>[43]</a></span>
stood by the wall of the inn yard, with one
red pony standing quietly beside it, and the
other enjoying a canter on his own account
about a quarter of a mile off, and rapidly
becoming a speck in the distance.
</p>

<p>
As we came up, our driver advanced to
us, with the pole and part of the carriage
in his hand, saying curtly, with the first
smile we had yet seen upon his countenance,
"The carriage is broken."
</p>

<p>
To use a slang expression, we both felt a
little "floored." "Yes," we replied to this
incontrovertible fact; "but don't you think
you had better catch the pony?"
</p>

<p>
Jehu acquiesced silently, and proceeded
in a leisurely manner up the road, where,
assisted by another man, he managed to
capture the recalcitrant pony in an incredibly
short space of time.
</p>

<p>
"Well," we inquired when he returned;
"and how are we to continue our journey?"
</p>

<p>
"You cannot."
</p>

<p>
"Won't the carriage hold together?"
</p>

<p>
"Mais non!"
</p>

<p>
"And how are we to get back to
Bastia?"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_44' name='Page_44'>[44]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I will mend it up enough for
that."
</p>

<p>
It was impossible to be angry with such
a piece of placid indifference as this man,
however much one might wish it; one
might as well have been angry with a sack
of wheat.
</p>

<p>
So we left him, humming softly to himself,
to mend up the carriage as best he
could, whilst we walked on towards the
Cap for a two or three hours' stroll.
</p>

<p>
The sun now lay hot upon the shadeless
road, which began to mount gently, keeping,
however, close above the seashore, and
always bastioned on its other side by rocky
walls, which after a while gave place to
massive lordly hills, green and steep, more
than one surmounted by ruined tower or
long deserted cloister, braving in solitary
grandeur the eastern gales that sweep each
crag-topped eminence.
</p>

<p>
It was a beautiful walk; only a little bit
marred by the unpleasant attentions of two
men in a mule cart. They passed once,
stopping the conveyance to offer us a seat,
which we declined; and afterwards shouting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_45' name='Page_45'>[45]</a></span>
and calling after us from a wayside inn,
where they had stopped.
</p>

<p>
On returning homeward, we were not
overpleased to see our persecutors again
coming after us in their blue blouses and
black wide-awakes.
</p>

<p>
Apparently their journey had been no
further than to the inn; and it was probably
not the first inn they had visited,
for they were more pressing and less agreeable
than ever. One man went so far as
to jump down from his seat, insisting upon
the advantages of a drive in the cart; and
it was only by walking on rapidly, with the
damping remark that we did not understand
a word they said (which, as they spoke a
harsh Italian patois, was nearly true), that
we at length managed to get rid of them.
This, I must remark, was the sole occasion
on which any one of us experienced any
rudeness or unpleasantness from the behaviour
of any grown up Corsican man or
woman. One could scarcely say as much
for many more frequented countries, after
incessant travelling for several weeks in
their loneliest and wildest regions.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_46' name='Page_46'>[46]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
On nearing Sisco, we met the carriage,
driver, and ponies coming slowly towards
us.
</p>

<p>
"See," said the coachman, with a gay,
placid smile, "am I not a good workman?"
And he pointed to the pole and broken
carriage, pieced together by his bits of
string. He really seemed to think the
breakage altogether quite a clever affair.
</p>

<p>
"How did the accident originally happen?"
we inquired.
</p>

<p>
"The ponies ran up against the wall
whilst I was out of sight for a moment,"
was the careless reply.
</p>

<p>
The man was evidently not a fool, but
his comfortable phlegm surpassed anything
I ever saw, out of Corsica.
</p>

<p>
On the road home, we passed another
round tower standing lonely by the roadside
overlooking the sea, and No. 3 got out to
sketch it. It was&mdash;like all the Genoese
towers which strew the country, standing
erect on every high cliff and commanding
hill&mdash;perfectly round and not very lofty,
but of immense thickness, and but little
ruined.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_47' name='Page_47'>[47]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Apparently, our coachman had not profited
much by his morning's lesson; for, whilst
we sat by the roadside, he found it more
to his taste to come and look over our
shoulders than to remain by his carriage.
The ponies were anxious to get home, and
would not stand. They had already taken
the empty carriage, with no guard save
Bigemark, half across the road, when I
pointed out the fact to Jehu.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," said he, composedly, "they will
stand."
</p>

<p>
"But," said No. 2, "they are <i>not</i> standing;
they are moving now."
</p>

<p>
Again he smiled silently.
</p>

<p>
"Is it your carriage?" I demanded of
the imperturbable man.
</p>

<p>
"Mais non!"
</p>

<p>
"Whose, then?"
</p>

<p>
"M. Stauffe, sans doute."
</p>

<p>
"Poor M. Stauffe! I am sorry for him.
His carriages must come expensive."
</p>

<p>
Jehu gave a momentary stare, and then
took the hint, and departed to his ponies.
</p>

<p>
No town could look more lovely than did
Bastia as we returned homewards. Framed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_48' name='Page_48'>[48]</a></span>
in by a foreground of noble cacti and of
green hills on one side, and blue sea on the
other, the shipping stood out against a
crimson sky, and the white houses lay in
the soft evening light against a range of
pink and blue and purple mountains.
</p>

<p>
The wind had moderated, and the Mediterranean,
as we entered the town and
passed along the broad quay, lay like a
shining sapphire against the dark mole;
but the calm was delusive, for at night
again the sirocco resumed its sway, and
a few hours later a vivid thunderstorm was
rolling over the angry sea.
</p>

<p>
Not much beyond Sisco lies Pino, a
village on the western shore, surrounded
by gardens, vineyards, and the residences
of some of the wealthiest of the islanders.
Not far from it is the celebrated tower of
Seneca, a round tower standing in stern
solitude on the summit of a pointed rock
rising from amongst the mountains and
overlooking two seas. We were very sorry
not to see this tower, although it is very
doubtful whether it deserves its name, and
whether the Roman philosopher, during his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_49' name='Page_49'>[49]</a></span>
eight years' exile in the uncongenial land
of Corsica, did really frequent these rocky
wilds in preference to the neighbouring
towns of Mariana or Aleria. Corsican
savagery and Corsican character were unpalatable
and incomprehensible to the
courtly, selfish stoic, and his comments
upon his hosts are little flattering. He
calls them liars, robbers, revengeful, and
irreligious, and will not even admit the
natural beauties of this "rude island,"
"desolate in situation, scanty in products,
and unhealthy in climate."
</p>

<p>
But the unhappy position of poor Seneca
may well explain his ill-temper. He might
write long-winded letters of consolation to
his mother, inculcating the beauty of resignation
and of a calm indifference to earthly
surroundings; but I have no doubt the sour
bread and stony roads tried the equanimity
of the polished Roman just as much as
they do that of the fastidious traveller nowadays,
who moreover comes, unlike Seneca,
by his own will and for his own pleasure.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_50' name='Page_50'>[50]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
CHAPTER IV.
<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">TO ISOLA ROSSA.</span>
</h2>

<p>
Our first long expedition in the island was
what may be called the north-western tour,
embracing the best part of a circle, and
comprising St. Florent, Ile Rousse and
Calvi; thence on to Corte.
</p>

<p>
This tour I think is a good one to begin
with, as it is on the whole less interesting
and beautiful than the others. After the
first day's drive, it does not abound so very
much in beauties, and it does abound to a
remarkable degree, even for Corsica, in dirt.
</p>

<p>
Yet, although not so wildly beautiful as
some of our expeditions, there was much
that was exceedingly picturesque and
curious; and Calvi, above all, is a town
worth going far to see.
</p>

<p>
There is only one way of travelling in
Corsica, for those who wish to see anything
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_51' name='Page_51'>[51]</a></span>
of the country and obtain any enjoyment
from their travels; and that is, in a private,
hired carriage, which&mdash;driver, horses, and
carriage&mdash;may be had at a reasonable rate
per day.
</p>

<p>
From Bastia we started in style, with a
roomy carriage and three horses, for which
luxurious equipage we paid thirty francs a
day; but charges are higher here than
at Ajaccio, and, in our other rounds, we
obtained an equally good carriage and two
horses, with a very superior coachman, for
twenty francs a day.
</p>

<p>
This is the usual charge all over the
island, and includes the keep of both driver
and horses; but half the return journey is
expected to be paid, as well as a douceur of
about two francs a day to the man.
</p>

<p>
In this case, the excuse was the hilly
roads and our heavy luggage, necessitating
a third horse; but I think our inexperience
was the real cause of the difference. It is
as well to fix the bargain beforehand, and
also to make some inquiries regarding the
man to whom you entrust your precious
lives and limbs for several days, as, on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_52' name='Page_52'>[52]</a></span>
these roads, a tipsy or inefficient driver
would be no joke. For the comfort of
timid travellers I may, however, as well
remark, that every Corsican seems born to
handle the reins, as a South Sea Islander
to swim; and, although very furious drivers,
they are remarkably safe ones. Also, that
their undoubtedly thirsty habits interfere
wonderfully little with their duties.
</p>

<p>
For instance, the drowsiness which is
prone to take possession of many Corsican
drivers after the midday halt and thenceforth,
and which causes them to nod
ominously on the box, has no effect apparently
upon a sort of sixth sense, which
wakes them up by instinct just in time for
a sharp turn, a steep descent, or a bad bit of
road.
</p>

<p>
This Bastia coachman of ours&mdash;a big,
rough, bullet-headed fellow&mdash;was not the
most sober of mankind; but, although
probably the worse for drink every evening
when off duty, he took care not to overstep
the nodding stage when in its discharge.
</p>

<p>
More than once, at the approach of some
nasty corner or sudden precipice, the point
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_53' name='Page_53'>[53]</a></span>
of an umbrella was levelled at the small
of his back; but it never had cause to
culminate in a prod, for, precisely at the
necessary moment, the furry cap adorning
the unkempt head, raised itself, and the
brown hands tightened their hold upon
the loose reins.
</p>

<p>
The best course, however, is to forget
both bad road and sleepy driver in the
glorious prospect that seldom is wanting in
Corsica; for a system of nervous watchfulness
is not conducive to comfort or
enjoyment.
</p>

<p>
It was not an auspicious day on which
we started on our tour. After an early
breakfast, we left the Hotel de France at
eight o'clock in pouring rain, and began
mounting the steep ascent to the Col
Teghine.
</p>

<p>
Steep, indeed, was the hill, and very
long; and the position of the third horse
was no sinecure. Fortune, however, favours
the brave; and before an hour was over,
the sun came peeping forth through many
a dark rift, blue clouds rose up and filled
the gaps, and the sunlight glanced sparkling
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_54' name='Page_54'>[54]</a></span>
on dewy flower and crystal-covered olive
grove. Thenceforth, the day was fine, and
showed to advantage one of the most
beautiful drives that can well be imagined.
</p>

<p>
Steep rose the green hills above and
below us, with the blue sea at every turn
stretching wide before us, and bringing out
into clearer prominence its three islands,
whilst the opposite shore of Tuscany lay a
soft blue line on the horizon. On the lower
slope, groups of olive, orange, and lemon
trees&mdash;the two latter in full fruit&mdash;and
the sun shining gaily on the many golden
balls; above us, banks of cystus, shining
arbutus and Mediterranean heath, with
foaming cascades pouring down from the
rocky hillsides, and rose-coloured cyclamen
and golden broom bending lovingly above
their banks.
</p>

<p>
Bastia, looked down upon from this road,
had a very picturesque appearance. It
seemed the only bit of life on the wide,
desolate-looking plain which stretched away
into dim distance to the south, bordered on
one side by the sea, and on the other by
the inland range of hills, and enclosing an
arm of the sea called the Lake of Bigulia.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_55' name='Page_55'>[55]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
There is said to have been a Roman
settlement and several large towns in this
region long ago; but now, all along the
extensive plain, the eye can only make out
one small village, and it has a pale, deserted
look, as if unloved by nature or by man.
</p>

<p>
And not without reason. From Bastia
downwards, almost to the southernmost
extremity of the island, this eastern coast
is flat, marshy, and malarious.
</p>

<p>
A man of forty is an old man in this
fatal district. Even the natives fly from it,
leaving its shores barren and uncultivated;
and the poor Italian labourer, who, more
industrious than his Corsican neighbour,
comes over the sea in spring to till the
soil, creeps up each night into the mountains,
to avoid sleeping in the deadly air.
</p>

<p>
When at length we reached the summit
of the Col Teghine, the view was magnificent.
We were on a narrow ridge 1735
feet high&mdash;on one side looking down upon
the eastern coast; on the other, upon scattered
mountains of every strange form, and
a vast panorama of western sea and coast.
The large gulf of San Fiorenzo lay before
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_56' name='Page_56'>[56]</a></span>
us, indescribably blue; and, into it, stretched
out arm after arm of wildest red and
purple rocks, glowing far, far below in
the cloudless atmosphere. Anything more
beautiful than those far-away vivid rock
ranges beneath our feet, it would be impossible
to conceive; and as for a moment,
with our hands full of lovely flowers, we
paused on the lonely sky-surrounded pass,
and threw ourselves down on the rich
maquis, a little lark rose from beside us, in
the still mountain hush, and gave voice to
nature's meaning. In another moment we
began the long descent to St. Florent, surrounded
by wild and rugged mountains,
the sea always beneath us, the steep road
winding along the flanks of barer and less
verdant hills, the maquis more abundant,
and the flowers rarer than on the other side.
</p>

<p>
For an hour or more we gallopped down,
passing a picturesque high towered church,
and finally going over a flat plain by the
winding shores of the lake-like gulf of St.
Florent. Then, with a sudden turn, into a
narrow unsavoury little street, where our
carriage could scarcely pass, and up to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_57' name='Page_57'>[57]</a></span>
door of a very uninviting inn, whose interior,
however, proved superior to its exterior.
</p>

<p>
Inns and innkeepers in Corsica may be
most correctly described as uninviting.
Whatever flourish of trumpets you make on
arriving, and however rare an event may
be the advent of a carriage of any description,
the proprietors never appear to
welcome you; and you are expected to toil
panting upstairs, all your baggage in your
arms, before meeting with any assistance.
And this very often in a place where the
excitement of a foreigner's coming has been
sufficient to rouse the entire population,
and send a score or two of shrieking
children at your heels.
</p>

<p>
The hall and staircase of this particular
inn were remarkably still and deserted;
and being then unused to Corsican eccentricities,
we felt doubtful, after one or two
silent flights, whether the stone staircase
led to anything more promising than empty
chambers. But at length, a long, low <span lang='fr_FR'><i>salle-a-manger</i></span>
burst upon us round a corner;
and here, with the assistance of a nice dog,
and in company with a party of remarkably
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_58' name='Page_58'>[58]</a></span>
lively Germans lately deposited by the
diligence, we managed to get through some
rather sheepy mutton cutlets, good cheese,
cakes, and wine, for the modest sum of
fifteen pence a-piece. We were likewise
offered a dish of raw ham; but this,
although included gratis in the bill of
fare, we declined politely.
</p>

<p>
St. Florent is a small and rather dirty
village, placed in most picturesque fashion
by the edge of the sea. Some of the houses
are built upon a narrow ridge of black rocks
running out into the sea, and have both
back and front washed by the waves and
sprinkled by the surf on stormy days.
</p>

<p>
It has a nice little quay, along which
were several good coasting vessels at
anchor.
</p>

<p>
From the inn, whose base was at the
water's edge, was a lovely view, spreading
across bright blue sea, and over the houses
on their rocky ledge to the rosy tinted
range of hills behind.
</p>

<p>
We were to rest here two hours, and
determined to take a sketch. But, being
about noon, the sun was blazing down upon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_59' name='Page_59'>[59]</a></span>
the unsheltered white road and on the
hard brown rocks in an unpleasant manner.
So Nos. 2 and 3 crept up a perpendicular
bit of cliff, on to a narrow, steep ledge,
where there was a foot or two of shade;
and here, with the cliff overhanging their
perch, and the wonderful water, malachite
and purple in its lights and shadows,
beneath them, indulged in happy contemplation
and artistic effort.
</p>

<p>
But, alas! solitude and silent reflection
are not possible to the English traveller in
Corsica; and although the boys of St.
Florent were a most superior lot, kind and
gentlemanly, they very soon invaded our
retreat&mdash;creeping along to us on hands and
knees (for our ledge necessitated this lowly
position), and offering for sale some pretty
shells, freshly gathered from their sea bed.
For the modest sum of three soldi, or three
halfpence, I invested in half a dozen of
these. But my St. Florent shells never
reached England.
</p>

<p>
Happening to look up from my sketch
a few minutes later, I found that the little
heap beside me had all dispersed, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_60' name='Page_60'>[60]</a></span>
walked themselves over the side of the
cliff; whilst one particular beauty, that I
had put in my pocket, having taken a little
longer to free himself from his embarrassing
situation, was yet in sight, making the best
of his hermit-crab way back to mother sea.
The small salesman evidently did not belong
to the anti-vivisection society, for, seeing
my discomfiture, he borrowed a hairpin
with much solemnity, and catching the
poor crab in mid career, began to pick him
out, raising his large brown eyes to us in
silent affliction when our humanitarian
principles forced us to stop this proceeding.
</p>

<p>
On returning towards the shore, we found
a small crowd of kindly intentioned women
and boys gathered on the rocks beneath, to
assist us in our perilous descent. Notwithstanding
this little obstruction, however,
we managed to alight safely, and rejoin
No. 1, who, from her baking seat below,
had been regarding our amphibious proceedings
with some anxiety.
</p>

<p>
Directly after leaving San Fiorenzo, we
began to ascend, the town behind us lying
on its little peninsula among the wide blue
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_61' name='Page_61'>[61]</a></span>
waters like a crystal, and backed by hills
glowing vividly in the hot noonday sun.
</p>

<p>
In an hour or two we reached the summit
of the Col Cerchio, where the scene changed,
the hills beside the road opened out, and
revealed to us a fine panorama of inland
mountains and villages.
</p>

<p>
The road to Ile Rousse lies nearly all
the way through barren rocky hills, varied
occasionally by greener cones. A wonderful,
weird-looking mountain of red granite,
called Monte Temorro, keeps always in
sight, sometimes at one side and sometimes
at the other of the winding road,
but its precipitous bare head never lost.
This mountain, in its bleakness, reminds me
strongly of the pictures of Quarantana in
Palestine.
</p>

<p>
The rocks grew wilder as at length we
reached more level ground, and here there
were some attempts at agriculture, refreshing
after so much barren scenery.
</p>

<p>
Jogging along on muleback, we met a
man and a woman, both seated on the same
beast. It is only round Bastia that the
Corsican women affect continental fashions
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_62' name='Page_62'>[62]</a></span>
and the side-saddle; everywhere else in the
island the women ride cavalier style, and
side-saddles are unknown. The two were
driving before them a large flock of native
sheep, black and white. Corsican sheep
are simply lovely. They have long, soft,
silky hair, instead of wool, upon their
bodies, and their faces are full of expression,
with large, pathetic brown eyes.
</p>

<p>
The road now wound again right over
the edge of the sea, and the clear green
waves dashed against the brown rocks
beneath us, and rolled in transparent curls
upon the sandy shore for many a mile,
watering with spray the rich shrubs that
clothed the cliff to the very water's edge.
</p>

<p>
Here, on many a lonely hill overlooking
the wide waste of waters, stood a massive,
round Genoese watch-tower&mdash;half-ruined
memorial of a cruel sway now passed, but
which for centuries crushed out happiness
and prosperity, although not resistance,
from the heroic little island.
</p>

<p>
It was between six and seven when we
reached Ile Rousse; but long before this,
the picturesque promontory from which it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_63' name='Page_63'>[63]</a></span>
takes its name was visible, standing far
out into the bay, blood-red against a sunset
sky.
</p>

<p>
The town, neat and tidy, lies at the
water's edge, backed by the white snow-cones
of Monte Pedro; but the rocks
themselves are distinct, and are connected
with it by a straggling little quay and long
wooden bridge. They are composed of a
long rough tongue of red sandstone, torn
and rent into every picturesque shape, and
running out into the sea for about a quarter
of a mile. On the furthest rock rose a
solemn watch-tower; on the nearer one,
some grey old ruins.
</p>

<p>
The sun was just setting as we walked
over the wooden bridge and climbed upon
a high point. The rocks gleamed a fiery
red where they caught the last rays, but
ghostly black shadows filled their crevices
below; and the old watch-tower looked
grandly out towards the French coast,
painted against an orange sky.
</p>

<p>
The road leading up from the quay was
shaded by an avenue of trees, and was
evidently the favourite evening stroll of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_64' name='Page_64'>[64]</a></span>
Ile Rousse upper ten. A great number of
the inhabitants were here, and we were
much edified by the polite manner with
which one and all raised their hats to us,
wishing us "bon soir," one nice-looking
Italian sailor, however, varying the salute
by offering it in English&mdash;we, of course,
responding in like manner, greatly to his
delight.
</p>

<p>
The bump of manly courtesy is evidently
well developed in Ile Rousse; for, coming
up the street, pursued by a horde of excited
children, shouting "Inglesé!" the tribe
were reprimanded and even caught and
pommelled by one or two of the smoking
idlers at the street corners.
</p>

<p>
We often experienced courtesy of this
sort amongst the Corsican men, who were
far too kind and too well-bred to enjoy
seeing us mobbed and annoyed by their
progeny; but unfortunately, as a rule, their
remonstrances proceeded no further than
words, and for a verbal remonstrance the
juvenile Corsican cares but little.
</p>

<p>
These Corsican children were a curious
study. In some few places, notably Corte
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_65' name='Page_65'>[65]</a></span>
and Propriano, the children were unboundedly
impudent; in some few others
again, quiet little country villages, they had
the modesty and simplicity to be expected
in sweet Auburn; but these were exceptions.
</p>

<p>
They are, generally speaking, utterly
fearless, but highly intelligent, eager to
follow and criticize your every step, and to
demand an answer to every question possible
regarding your person and your nationality;
but quite open to friendliness.
</p>

<p>
To those who are neither afraid of them
nor angry with them, the pursuing horde
will generally, after a few moments, show
both civility and politeness. The age of
chivalry in Corsica comes early. At thirteen,
or even younger, a Corsican boy becomes a
courteous young gentleman; and we soon
learnt to feel at ease regarding our tormentors
if we saw any approaching to that
civilizing period of life.
</p>

<p>
The inn at Ile Rousse was not uncomfortable,
and in appearance was vastly
superior to many to which we went later
on. We hoped and believed it was the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_66' name='Page_66'>[66]</a></span>
abode of cleanliness; but, alas! hopes and
appearances are delusive. The food, however,
was excellent.
</p>

<p>
On our return from our twilight walk, we
found our little table d'hôte dinner awaiting
us, consisting of good soup, boiled beef,
excellent duck, salad, cheese, "gateaux de
Corse," and dessert. There were other
diners in the general salle; but in consideration
of our sex and our gentility, our
dinner was brought to us in a smaller
detached room.
</p>

<p>
The diners, however, soon cleared away;
and when we entered the salle-a-manger to
write our letters, we found the young landlady
and her sister quite ready for a chat.
</p>

<p>
This was our first introduction to an
almost invariable custom in small Corsican
inns. The reserved Briton who would
decline the after-dinner chat with his host
or hostess, would be considered here a very
churlish individual.
</p>

<p>
Our landlady, we found, was quite a
historical character, being no other than
the young woman of the "rose," named in
Mr. Lear's book on Corsica. She was not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_67' name='Page_67'>[67]</a></span>
quite so young now as then, it being eleven
years since that episode; but she was still
blooming, and as gay and talkative as a
tame parrot; and whenever she laughed,
(and that was not seldom or gently,) she
shook the long plait of black hair that hung
down her back until it danced again.
</p>

<p>
First presenting us each with a handsome
bouquet of flowers "out of the garden," she
and her sister drew their chairs up to the
table, and leaning their elbows upon it,
prepared for an hour's good gossip. Every
one of our nation who had ever visited Ile
Rousse was described to us minutely, with
the inquiry as to whether we knew him;
and the visitor's book, with its laudatory
remarks and poetical effusions, shown us,
with the urgent entreaty that we would
translate those of them that were written in
English.
</p>

<p>
This we did, refusing, however, when we
were requested to indite a poem on our own
account therein.
</p>

<p>
This was a sore disappointment to the
"lady of the rose," who declared emphatically
of No. 1 that she had <span lang="fr_FR">"la physiognomie
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_68' name='Page_68'>[68]</a></span>
poetique!"</span> but who recovered herself the
next moment, and begged that we would,
on our way upstairs, peep at any rate into
the beautiful best bedroom, which she
generally gave to her English guests, and
which we should have had, had we sent a
telegram beforehand to say we were coming,
but which unfortunately was now occupied
by a Corsican messieur.
</p>

<p>
So much occupied was it, that it was not
until we were fairly in the show apartment,
that we discovered that the occupant was
already in bed, sleeping the sleep of the
just!
</p>

<p>
We were not aware then, what we learnt
later on, how necessary a thing it is in
Corsica to telegraph one's coming beforehand.
It insures a good dinner; and, at any
rate, a room swept out to a certain degree.
</p>

<p>
You pay a penny a word for telegraphic
messages, and there is scarcely a village in
the country without its office. Without a
telegram, you may arrive to find no rooms,
or, what is almost as bad, to be placed in
rooms out of which the <i>family</i> have kindly
turned for your accommodation. We soon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_69' name='Page_69'>[69]</a></span>
learnt by experience to have a perfect
horror of these "family rooms."
</p>

<p>
The accumulated garments of the family
lie about in all directions, your jug and
basin are even more lilliputian than elsewhere,
your bed quilt is grimy (they do not
often supply you with blankets in Corsica),
and the apartment appears, from its fugginess,
never to have known the luxury of
open windows.
</p>

<p>
A gun also occasionally peeps at you from
a corner, and a pistol from the mantle-piece;
and the family run in at all hours
for their blacking brushes, their best boots,
or a bottle of <i>vin ordinaire</i> on the top of
the household chest: but these are small
matters.
</p>

<p>
Very beautiful looked the sea, lapping
against the walls of the houses, and scattering
spray over the red rocks, at 6 a.m. next
morning; but in an hour it had clouded
over, and sea and sky and rocks were all
leaden grey in a lowering thunderstorm.
At nine o'clock, however, it cleared up a
little, and we started for Calvi, passing
through green meadows and cultivated land
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_70' name='Page_70'>[70]</a></span>
to the summit of a mountain, and down
again to the village of Algajola by the sea
shore. Loving maquis clothed the limestone
hills as we ascended again, looking
beyond the grey crags, covered with soft
green moss or scarlet leeks, to the village
and ancient castle of Lumio. Long before
we reached them, the snow mountains were
raising white heads over the green hills
before us; and as we paused on the summit
of the second pass, the full view of the
magnificent bay of Calvi burst upon us,
sweeping out as far as the eye could reach,
and glowing in the midday sun.
</p>

<p>
Figs, lemons, and prickly pear bordered
our road as we descended through rocky
hills to the long narrow level tract preceding
Calvi; and, all the way, the wide
blue sea beckoned on one side to the solemn
range of snowy Alps upon the other.
</p>

<p>
It is impossible to describe the exceeding
picturesqueness of the town and citadel as
you approach from this road. Calvi lies
upon a peninsula of high ground jutting
out into the sea, and consists of two distinct
towns&mdash;the lower, at the water's edge; and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_71' name='Page_71'>[71]</a></span>
the upper, which comprises the citadel,
built upon the hill.
</p>

<p>
The citadel, with the exception of Bonifacio,
is the strongest in the island. Its
bastion walls are of an immense height,
gleaming white against the blue sky, and
their thickness and impregnability are equal
to their height. Nine or ten times have
these bastion walls been assailed by foes of
every nation, including the English, wearing
out the very heart of the foe by their
stern resistance, and often finally foiling his
most determined efforts.
</p>

<p>
Planted upon inaccessible rocks commanding
the sea, and formed by the very
nature of its position for defence, the
Genoese at an early date (about the fourteenth
century) fortified it thus strongly;
and although sometimes losing it for a
while, yet managed to keep it in their
hands for long centuries. Bonifacio and
Calvi, both to a certain degree colonized
by Genoese families, and filled with Genoese
soldiers, were for many years the main, and
often the only, cords by which this cruel
and tyrannical government held on to unfortunate
Corsica.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_72' name='Page_72'>[72]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
In the year 1735, a romantic little incident
occurred upon this coast. It was
towards the conclusion of one of the
innumerable Corsican struggles against
Genoese despotism, when, in the hopeless
but undying cause of liberty, the blood of
the islanders had been shed with an unwearied
devotion and unassisted heroism
that at last moved the heart of the practical
but freedom-loving Briton to a sudden burst
of sympathetic feeling. It would be a pity
to tell the story in any other words but
those of Gregorovius.
</p>

<p>
"Their embarrassments had become almost
insupportable, when, one day, two strange
vessels came to anchor in the Gulf of Isola
Rossa (Ile Rousse), and began to discharge
a heavy cargo of victuals and warlike stores&mdash;gifts
for the Corsicans from unknown and
mysterious donors. The captains of the
vessels scorned all remuneration, and only
asked the favour of some Corsican wine in
which to drink the brave nation's welfare.
They then put out to sea again, amid the
blessings of the multitude who had assembled
on the shore to see their foreign
benefactors.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_73' name='Page_73'>[73]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"This little token of foreign sympathy
fairly intoxicated the poor Corsicans. Their
joy was indescribable: they rang the bells
in all the villages; they said to one another
that Divine Providence, and the Blessed
Virgin, had sent their rescuing angels to
the unhappy island, and their hopes grew
lively that some foreign power would at
length bestow its protection on Corsica....
Generous Englishmen had equipped
these two ships...."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_74' name='Page_74'>[74]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
CHAPTER V.
<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">THE CURÉ OF CALVI.</span>
</h2>

<p>
Driving through an irregular little street
with overhanging houses, our coachman
suddenly stopped before a dirty stone staircase.
This, he informed us, was the entrance
to our hotel. We were suspicious; and the
event proved how just were our suspicions.
</p>

<p>
It seemed incredible that a large town
like Calvi should furnish no better inn than
this wretched looking one; besides which,
we had been distinctly advised to go to a
certain Madame Puoggi in the Haute Ville,
and this was the Basse Ville.
</p>

<p>
But it was impossible to move our stolid
coachman. This was the best, the only inn
in Calvi: he had never heard of Madame
Puoggi: there was no inn in the upper
town at all. Alas! we afterwards discovered
that this degenerate Corsican lied
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_75' name='Page_75'>[75]</a></span>
in this, as in other matters; and that fate
and his obstinacy had led us to the third
best inn in the town! But, unable ourselves
to discover the mysterious Madame
Puoggi, we were forced to submit to destiny.
</p>

<p>
The sun was shining hotly upon white
(or what had been white) pavement, when
we descended from the carriage, and the
scene was one of the gayest and most
pictorial I ever looked upon.
</p>

<p>
A narrow, uneven street, houses with
tumbledown balconies and broken stone
staircases, opening out before us to a wide
white quay with the gleaming sea alongside,
and a row of vessels like Arab dhows
at anchor, drying their long drooping sails
in the sun.
</p>

<p>
Behind these, the grand old citadel, white
and fierce, looking down with the pride of
five centuries upon quay and town, and sea
and hill; and from the opposite coast, as
far as the eye could reach northward, a
chain of receding blue mountains.
</p>

<p>
Most of the vessels had come from the
African coast, bringing a motley array of
foreign sailors.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_76' name='Page_76'>[76]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
As our carriage drew up, three ghostly
beings, draped in white sheeting from head
to foot, with nought but black beard and
shining black eyes emerging, stood motionless,
a yard or two off, silently watching our
unbelieving footsteps as we entered the inn.
Calvi is full of these stately Arabs. Every
corner you turn, you find one or two sitting
squatting in the sun in their white sheets,
still as statues, but silently following you
with eyes full of a contemptuous astonishment.
</p>

<p>
After a hasty lunch in a room overhanging
the emerald sea, and where a balcony
looked straight into its depths&mdash;a room with
the most perfect view ever framed by
nature, but greatly marred by man's neglect
of drainage&mdash;we went out to explore the
citadel.
</p>

<p>
Passing along the gay quay, and ascending
a steep slope of stones and rubbish
between the houses, we found ourselves on
the hill from whence sprung the bastion
walls, surrounded by sea on every side save
one.
</p>

<p>
It made one almost giddy to stand at the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_77' name='Page_77'>[77]</a></span>
base of these great sloping walls, and look
up their lofty face; and one felt no surprise
at the numerous shocks they had defied.
Then, by a steep narrow ascent, cut in the
rock and protected by stony walls, we
mounted into the heart of the citadel, and
the haute ville within. This haute ville,
enclosed by the fortifications, is the original
old town; the basse ville below being of
much later date.
</p>

<p>
The houses inside the citadel were all of
stone, and although close together, in
narrow, winding stony streets, up which no
vehicle could possibly go, were built with
some attempt at regularity, and were not so
dirty looking as those in the lower town.
There being absolutely nothing but stone
in the haute ville, the streets were comparatively
free from dust, and the high
wind that swept over this lofty perch sent
a sweet refreshing air through the walled-in
causeways.
</p>

<p>
The church stood in the main street, in
the centre of the citadel. Repairs were
going on inside, and we strolled in, being
soon joined by the curé, a man about thirty,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_78' name='Page_78'>[78]</a></span>
with a thin pale face and a sweet smile.
Gentle goodness was written on the features
of this man; and very shy was he before
three strange Englishwomen, and altogether
nervous of his French idioms, but with a
Corsican enthusiasm in his wild dark eyes.
The church, he told us, was built in 1100,
but partially destroyed by fire (coming, of
course, from an enemy's bombshell!) about
two hundred years ago, as an inscription cut
upon the outside steps testified. He showed
us the old font of black and white and red
Corsican marble, belonging to the fifteenth
century, of which age also was the marble
altar. A strange old bas-relief in the chancel
wall was much older than this, and had
been only lately found and uncovered.
"Calvi," said the curé, with his dark eyes
glowing, "has been bombarded eight or ten
times, but she has never succumbed. The
church is as strong as the rest of her fortifications,
and has resisted many a siege.
She has never been taken, <span lang="fr_FR">'si ce n'était pas
par les Anglais.'"</span> He showed us a large,
badly executed statue of our Lord, placed
within a most curious and beautiful old
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_79' name='Page_79'>[79]</a></span>
frame, composed of separate small squares
of oil-paintings on sacred subjects.
</p>

<p>
"See," he said, "there used to be a life-size
picture of the Saviour inside that
frame, and it was very ancient and beautiful.
It hung upon that wall opposite, under the
western window; but the English, in bombarding
our citadel, sent a ball clean through
the wall and shot away the picture. So we
removed it here behind the altar, and placed
this statue within the frame."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" said No. 1, "that was Nelson's
doing."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said the curé, with one of his shy
bright smiles, "it was your great naval
commander, Nelson. But, although he
took Calvi, and destroyed the picture, he
left an eye behind him!"
</p>

<p>
And this was true enough.
</p>

<p>
"But," said No. 3, "you Corsicans like
the English, do you not? They have often
been friendly to you."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he replied; "the English are a
free nation, and they can feel for those who
fight for liberty."
</p>

<p>
We were quite sorry to say good-bye to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_80' name='Page_80'>[80]</a></span>
our new friend, as we left him standing on
the steps of his grand old church, the wind
lifting his black hair, and a farewell smile
lighting up the refined, visionary face, as he
crossed himself with a thin brown hand.
</p>

<p>
Leaving the church, we wandered amongst
the mazes of the little streets, which seemed
strangely deserted in the midday sun; feeling
glad at length to leave the strong glare
of the citadel, and descend to the sea and
lower town.
</p>

<p>
In doing so we missed our way among
the many loopholed stone passages, and
No. 1, fired by a desire to rouse one of those
impassive white statues and hear his voice,
stopped short before an Arab crouched upon
a step, demanding of him our whereabouts.
</p>

<p>
The white bundle with the swarthy face,
however, treated us with the contempt due
to our temerity, never even taking the
trouble to raise his black eyes, but keeping
his stolid gaze fixed upon the sea before
him.
</p>

<p>
I began to think these doubled-up men
could not move, so motionless were they;
and felt quite relieved when, later on in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_81' name='Page_81'>[81]</a></span>
the evening, I saw them striding, positively
running&mdash;turbans unloosed, white robes
flapping, and shoes and stockings showing&mdash;up
and down the streets, buying provisions
preparatory to a start.
</p>

<p>
The shore of the bay surrounding Calvi
is wide and smooth, with a fine sand and
pretty shells, including a vast number of
the mauve-coloured <i>Donax</i>. The morning
mists were clearing away, and it was very
pleasant to lie here, as we did, basking in
the sun, watching snow peak after snow
peak, behind the blue hills opposite, slowly
unveil itself and stand out in a lovely white
glow. The snow looked so close and so cool,
bowing over the hot sands, and throwing
shadows on to the sea beneath.
</p>

<p>
Coming home across the sandhills, which
separate the shore from the level road, we
came upon the most perfect and beautiful
flowers I ever saw. They were a species
of low growing cactus, only rising a few
inches from the ground, the blossoms of a
most brilliant rose colour. They had the
appearance of chrysanthemums, and were
about three or four inches across, covering
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_82' name='Page_82'>[82]</a></span>
the sandhills for yards with an unbroken
sheet of vivid crimson.
</p>

<p>
Returning to the inn, we found our dinner
awaiting us, as well as three native "gentlemen,"
who were anxious to commence
operations at their table, but could not do
so until our advent.
</p>

<p>
These were the three avocats who, we
had been previously informed, unfortunately
occupied the three best bedrooms. These
individuals we necessarily looked upon as
our natural enemies; and our prejudice
against them was not mitigated by the
terrific noise made by them and the pretty
waitress together.
</p>

<p>
She was a fat, untidy, golden-haired
blonde; one of the prettiest women I ever
saw in or out of Corsica, but gifted with
the strongest faculty for banging about
earthenware and metal utensils that could
well be imagined.
</p>

<p>
This was the spoilt child of the house,
adopted, we were informed, by the dark
young hostess because of her superior
education, which enabled her to talk French
to the guests. And talk French she did,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_83' name='Page_83'>[83]</a></span>
unceasingly&mdash;to the male guests, at any
rate; standing with arms akimbo against
the wall, chaffing <span lang="fr_FR">Messieurs les avocats</span> to
our utter neglect, and making such a babel,
between crockery flung about and shrieking
repartee, that we felt strongly inclined
to throw a plate at her touzled golden
head.
</p>

<p>
Dinner, however, was achieved at last;
and on re-entering our rooms, what a sight
met us!
</p>

<p>
The sun had just set, and twilight was
creeping on, but the whole of the near
range of hills opposite lay bathed in a
crimson glow that was almost blood red,
and was reflected in the clear waters below.
The glow remained for about five minutes,
and then gradually faded away into the
soft grey of evening. Never in my life did
I see anything more beautiful or vivid than
that sunset glow at Calvi.
</p>

<p>
Nos. 2 and 3 soon found that no retirement
was to be had in their chamber.
The low open window looked out upon a
balcony, which led up by steps direct from
the main street of the town.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_84' name='Page_84'>[84]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The window-sill was just of a convenient
height for the populace to lean their elbows
upon, which they accordingly did, in large
numbers. We could only shut out our
visitors by closing both windows and inside
shutters; and we preferred the populace.
</p>

<p>
At last came a swarthy black-browed
Italian, introduced by the pretty waitress,
whose noisy admirers had departed with
their cigars down the street, and who therefore
had nothing better to do than to gossip
with us. He was a sailor, and his hands
were full of pretty trinkets of coral and
lava, picked up by himself.
</p>

<p>
His Italian patois was peculiar, and the
waitress acted interpreter, whilst we bargained
for his wares. He was a queer
looking man, as black and dirty as soot and
absence of soap and water could make him,
with a passionate, cut-throat looking face,
that broke out occasionally into childlike
smiles.
</p>

<p>
The bargains being completed to every
one's satisfaction, No. 1, who alone of us
three could make herself understood by our
dark friend, plunged him suddenly into a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_85' name='Page_85'>[85]</a></span>
condition of hopeless confusion and swarthy
blushes by requesting of him a song.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, madame, I cannot sing!"
</p>

<p>
"What! an Italian sailor not sing?"
</p>

<p>
"No, no; indeed, madame, I cannot."
</p>

<p>
"What, not this?" and madame hummed
a gay boating song.
</p>

<p>
If our friend did not sing the song, it was
clear that he knew the words of it well,
for on hearing them he became greatly
excited, seizing both madame's hands in his
and pressing them affectionately.
</p>

<p>
Some weeks later, when at Ajaccio, Nos.
2 and 3, strangely enough, again lighted
upon our sailor friend. He was standing at
the hotel door with a companion, armed
with fresh corals and some lovely feathery
seaweed. He seemed delighted to see us
again, inquiring effusively after No. 1, and
informing us that he had worked his way
on foot from Calvi.
</p>

<p>
By the time our sailor had departed, it
was growing dark. But our visitors were
not over. The door opened, and in trooped
four or five people, carrying with them the
"canapie" which was to be devoted to our
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_86' name='Page_86'>[86]</a></span>
use for the night, and proceeding leisurely,
amidst much gossip, to make the bed.
</p>

<p>
We understood and tolerated the presence
of the master of the house over this ceremony;
but I was a little puzzled by the
comfortable deportment of a tidily dressed
young man, who came in with the rest,
examined the shells upon the dressing-table,
and entered into easy conversation with us.
</p>

<p>
I inquired of giddy golden-head who he
was.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," she said, carelessly, "he is a friend
of ours; mate of a vessel in the harbour."
</p>

<p>
I made no response to this, for I began
to feel my ignorance regarding manners and
customs in Corsica.
</p>

<p>
The next morning, the usual rain was
pouring down in bucketsful overhead; but
very thankful were we, after a sleepless
night, an early breakfast, and a dear bill,
to depart from Hotel Colombani, with its
indescribable dirt and smells, its exquisite
views, and its loud waitress.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_87' name='Page_87'>[87]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
CHAPTER VI.
<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">THE HAUTE BALAGNE.</span>
</h2>

<p>
The road from Calvi to Belgodere, usually
the third day's journey from Bastia, mounts
nearly the whole way, Calvi being on the
sea level, and the village of Belgodere high
up amongst the hills. It passes along one
of the most famous routes in Corsica, that
which runs through the mountains overlooking
the Haute and Basse Balagne.
</p>

<p>
The Balagne shares with Cap Corse the
reputation of being the richest and best
cultivated district in Corsica, and consists
of a splendid valley, apparently from three
to seven miles wide, filled with rich grain
fields and vineyards, and scattered with
fruit trees. Oranges, cherries, and figs
lined the road, and crept down towards the
valley, varied by thick groves of olives. As
the road ascended more and more, the view
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_88' name='Page_88'>[88]</a></span>
across the valley becomes more extensive
and magnificent, until at length the most
splendid panorama of mountain ranges, of
snow Alps, and of peeps of blue sea, lies
before the traveller.
</p>

<p>
Both Mr. Lear and Miss Campbell speak
of this Balagne country as one of the most
beautiful conceivable, and its views as unparalleled;
but, unfortunately for us, we
passed the first half of it in a downpour
that veiled everything a dozen yards off with
a thick white curtain. The second half was
seen imperfectly, yet grandly, as the sun
broke out in gleams, parting the mists in
eccentric mood; showing here a mountain,
there a bit of sea, and further on a line of
sparkling valley.
</p>

<p>
For several miles we had to return upon
our yesterday's road, but at Lumio branched
off. The castle was wrapped in a grey cloak
this morning; and long before we could see
them, we heard the numerous swollen cascades
rushing down the hillside in front of
us, then dashing below in a leaping waterfall
as we passed over the stone bridge.
</p>

<p>
The drenching rain had now continued
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_89' name='Page_89'>[89]</a></span>
three hours, making a temporary bath of the
bottom of our carriage, and dripping in a
melancholy sequence of drops through the
rather ancient hood above our heads.
</p>

<p>
Stopping at the half-way house, to bait
the horses, we found they were better off
than we, for that absolutely nothing was
procurable for lunch but sour bread and uneatable
goat's cheese.
</p>

<p>
Both mind and body were beginning to
feel thoroughly damped, when a sudden
lifting of the clouds, and ray of blessed sunshine,
revived our hopes and restored our
equanimity. We left off feeding the handsome,
timid retriever, who, sitting half-drowned
in the middle of the river course
which we called our road, was gratefully
accepting bits of brown dusty bread, and
began to look about us. All around the
olives were trembling with the rain, looking
more purely silver than ever with the dewdrops
hanging on their grey foliage, and
beneath our feet stretched the rich,
winding valley, filled with rolling banks of
vapour.
</p>

<p>
Scattered thickly over the valley were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_90' name='Page_90'>[90]</a></span>
the houses of the proprietors; and a village
nestled in every available mountain cranny,
and on many a hill top.
</p>

<p>
Speloncato especially, a village on the
summit of a very high conical hill, is most
picturesque, and followed us all the way to
Belgodere, the road winding round it.
</p>

<p>
The sun had a magical effect, not only in
lifting the thick curtain that hung before
nature's fine panorama, but in drying the
broad level road. The roads throughout
Corsica, with very few exceptions, are first
rate. They are kept smooth and in good
repair, and are often soft as park drives.
Many of them were constructed by the First
Napoleon, and are perhaps his best legacy
to his native land.
</p>

<p>
In an hour the water course had almost
dried up, and the steep ascent became less
dragging to the tired horses.
</p>

<p>
A lovely snow mountain rose suddenly up
from the very road-side, and a cold wind
blew between the crevices of the hills upon
us.
</p>

<p>
Belgodere is a large, picturesquely placed
village of twelve hundred inhabitants, rising
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_91' name='Page_91'>[91]</a></span>
up the side of a sugar loaf hill, backed by
ranges of mountains, and looking over lower
hills in front to the Mediterranean below.
</p>

<p>
The tiny village inn was more unpretentious
than any we had yet seen. The doorway
was about equal to that of a labourer's
cottage in England, and the little broken
wooden staircase up which we went was
dark and dirty. The bedrooms, however,
were a pleasing disappointment. There
were only two in the house, prepared for
the reception of guests; but they were spotlessly
clean, and, as we afterwards found,
very comfortable.
</p>

<p>
The man and his wife, as usual accompanied
by all the family, (in this case only
consisting of an octogenarian father, one or
two small children, and four cats,) escorted
us to our rooms, and apologized for the fact
that we could not have the third room, as
it was occupied by <span lang="fr_FR">"les vers."</span> This explanation
rather tickling my curiosity, and
being anxious to know whether <span lang="fr_FR">"les vers"</span>
could, by any possibility, desert their room
for ours, which I felt undesirable, I presently
peeped into the third apartment, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_92' name='Page_92'>[92]</a></span>
found it a mass of sleepy silk-worms, hard
at work absorbing cabbage leaves. In this
part of the country, a great many silk-worms
are kept, and they are more lucrative
than occasional guests. This was not the
only occasion on which we found them filling
one of the best bedrooms, to our exclusion.
</p>

<p>
After depositing our wraps, we went out,
and were conjured to mount the <span lang="fr_FR">"Rocher"</span>
on the very top of the hill; where, as our
landlady informed us, all <span lang="fr_FR">"les Anglais"</span>
went to see the view of the Balagne.
</p>

<p>
The opinion of society, as expressed in the
inn, being too much for us, we accordingly
climbed over stony ruts, and up a steep
stone staircase to the Rocher, in a tearing
wind, and escorted by twenty or thirty
excited children. There we found the view,
as we had expected, precisely the same as
that we had seen on our drive hither.
</p>

<p>
We accordingly returned to our six
o'clock dinner, when we were informed that
we must not open the windows of the little
sitting-room, as the silk-worms did not like
it, and it might give them cold!
</p>

<p>
The dinner was, as usual, very good, consisting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_93' name='Page_93'>[93]</a></span>
of soup, a very excellent little Mediterranean
fish, called sahl, haricot beans,
and fowl, finishing with the national dish of
broccia. Broccia, or "brasch," as some of
the country people call it, is a pudding
made of the pressed curds of goat's milk.
You get it almost every day for breakfast,
lunch, or dinner, in the inland parts of the
island, and it is excellent, mixed either with
a little lemon, or a sauce of brandy and
sugar. It is a trifle insipid by itself.
</p>

<p>
After dinner, the cats all paid us a visit,
and then the dear old octogenarian came in
and had a chat, showing us an Italian sort
of <i>British Workman</i>, profusely illustrated,
which he seemed to consider an untold
treasure, and which he said had been given
him two years ago, by a <span lang="fr_FR">"gentille jeune
Anglaise."</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_94' name='Page_94'>[94]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
CHAPTER VII.
<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">THE COUNTRY OF SERAFINO AND MASSONI.</span>
</h2>

<p>
The next morning, at half-past seven, we
left pretty Belgodere among its wild hills,
saying good-bye to the simple-hearted proprietors
of the clean little rooms, to the
courteous old octogenarian, and to the four
cats.
</p>

<p>
All night long the nightingales had been
shouting, from under a clear sky, through
our open windows; but the clouds began to
lower as we started, and a showery day
ensued.
</p>

<p>
For several hours we continued mounting
towards the Col Colombano, the cultivated
Basse Balagne lying at our feet, and the
noblest views of sea and mountain constantly
before us. Belgodere was at no mean
elevation; and, as we mounted higher and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_95' name='Page_95'>[95]</a></span>
still higher amongst the "everlasting hills,"
ranges of mountains of every colour lay, one
behind the other, before us&mdash;red, blue and
purple&mdash;some veiled in half mists, and some
shining with a far-away sunlight,&mdash;separated
from us by miles of grey atmosphere.
</p>

<p>
Over our heads and under our feet, great
white masses of cloud were constantly passing
hurriedly, often wrapping us in a fine
rain, and hiding from us, for a few moments,
everything but their own chilly grey curtain.
</p>

<p>
At the summit of the Col the sun broke
out for a few minutes, and lit up a most
magnificent view. It seemed as if we could
go no higher. Everything lay beneath us,
to the very edge of the distant soft horizon,
and the hush of Nature in her solitude and
her solemnity fell gently over sea and land
and sky.
</p>

<p>
Not a sound was to be heard among
those lonely hills; and yet the silence was
eloquent, as is always such a summer
silence up in the heights.
</p>

</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
The road at the Col split into two; and,
taking the inland one, we began at once to
descend rapidly, leaving behind us the magnificent
views and the blue sky, and turning
into monotonous green hills, sloping down
to a river bordered by willows, and a
colourless sky, whose leaden clouds were
discharging themselves with a quiet persistence
that denoted their "staying"
properties.
</p>

<p>
Our mid-day halt was at Ponte alle
Lecchia, where the river, widening out
and dashing in white foam, throws itself
over boulders of bright green porphyry
under a handsome bridge. Ponte alle
Lecchia is an inconsiderable village, but
it is the junction between the Bastia and
Calvi roads, and every diligence stops here
on the road from Bastia to Corte. The
little inn, before which we stopped, was
wretched and filthy, and they had absolutely
nothing in the house but bread and sardines,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_97' name='Page_97'>[97]</a></span>
for which they charged us a high price. I
say "nothing," for I mean nothing eatable
by civilized people. We were, as usual,
offered bacon and cheese; but, as the first
was raw, and the second could have been
smelt a quarter of a mile off, these we
declined.
</p>

<p>
We made, however, a good fire of blazing
sticks on the open hearth, and, surrounded
by the curious eyes of all the inmates of
the inn, guests or otherwise, dried our
soaked garments.
</p>

<p>
The hills between Belgodere and Ponte
alle Lecchia were the home of the celebrated
bandit Serafino.
</p>

<p>
Serafino was a man of war, as is every
bandit; but he appears to have been of
gentlemanly manners. His death occurred
about thirty years ago, and many stories
are preserved of his courtesy to women,
and his protection of the poor. The
Corsican bandit, as a rule, never robs: he
is supported, either by the produce of his
flocks, which he brings in by night to his
native village, or by the voluntary contributions
of his relations.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_98' name='Page_98'>[98]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
But, on one occasion, when Serafino
found it absolutely necessary that he should
possess himself of a pair of new boots, he
demanded them with so much courtesy
from a solitary officer of gendarmerie, not
fully armed, that that individual must have
felt the loss of his property almost compensated
for by the genteel politeness of
the robber. Serafino never permitted the
poor to be molested, and it is related of him
that he one day pursued and slew with his
own hand a thief, who, under the false
cover of his dreaded name, had deprived
a peasant of his wallet,&mdash;restoring his possessions
to the poor traveller.
</p>

<p>
Serafino, although a bandit pursued incessantly
by the law, did not find sufficient
excitement in his skirmishes with the
French gendarmes, and kept up a lively
vendetta on his own account with a fellow-bandit
named Massoni.
</p>

<p>
On one of these occasions on which the
brother bandits chanced to meet each other
in the lonely maquis, Massoni's shot took
effect, and deprived his enemy thenceforth
of one of his fingers.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_99' name='Page_99'>[99]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
About the year 1850, Serafino met with
the almost invariable end of the bandit.
He was shot dead by the soldiers whilst
lying asleep in his cave, having been betrayed
by some villagers.
</p>

<p>
With all other bandits, he was hunted
from hill to hill like a wild beast by the
gendarmes, who showed no mercy and gave
no quarter to the men who would have
scorned to receive it, and whose whole life
was spent in outwitting and murdering
them and their companions.
</p>

<p>
Wonderfully brave, and even noble hearted,
were many of these Corsican bandits; and
it seems sad that apparently a mere chance
of life should throw splendid qualities, an
indomitable energy, and dauntless courage,
into the cause of murder and vagabondism.
</p>

<p>
Massoni, the enemy of Serafino, roamed
about the same fastnesses, and originally
belonged to a Balagna family.
</p>

<p>
He was by birth a gentleman, and brave
as a lion; but the unhappy vendetta had
driven him from his home, believing himself
a righteous avenger, but pursued by the
gendarmes as a murderer.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_100' name='Page_100'>[100]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
For many years he lived amongst the
mountains of La Haute Balagne, in company
with his brother and another bandit
called Arrighi, keeping the French police
at bay, and in their frequent contests killing
numbers of their pursuers.
</p>

<p>
The trio were supported by their relations,
and were surrounded by friendly
shepherds. But treachery, incited by a
rough action, overtook them at last.
</p>

<p>
Massoni was one day visited by a friend
from his own village in Balagna, who came
to ask his advice and assistance regarding
the revenge to be taken on a man of
position who had insulted his family.
Massoni, wishing to treat his guest hospitably,
requested a lamb from a friendly
shepherd. His request was not refused,
but Massoni took offence at the leanness of
the gift. "It is for a guest; I must have
a fat one," said he; and without further
ceremony he chose out his lamb, and,
shooting it down, carried it off in his
arms.
</p>

<p>
The shepherd had neither the power nor
the daring to resist the bandit, or openly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_101' name='Page_101'>[101]</a></span>
resent his rudeness, but he determined to
pay him out for what he had done.
</p>

<p>
Soon after the departure of Massoni he
left his rocky cabin among the hills, and,
descending to the gendarmerie, offered to
betray the hiding-place of the bandits.
</p>

<p>
Cautiously, and in great numbers, the
gendarmes mounted the steep hill, until at
length the shepherd paused before an
almost inaccessible cave, the mouth of
which was entirely hidden by the maquis.
Arrighi and Massoni's brother were within,
asleep; but Massoni himself kept watch at
the entrance.
</p>

<p>
He had not heard the soldiers creeping
noiselessly up the rocky paths, and now
he was surrounded, some above, and some
below. Nothing was audible, until one of
the soldiers, to find out if the men were
really there, threw a stone from above into
the thick bushes at the cave's mouth.
</p>

<p>
Massoni sprang out to see the danger,
firing off his pistol to awaken his companions,
who started up from their sleep
as he fell upon the cavern floor, pierced by
the balls of the soldiers.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_102' name='Page_102'>[102]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
And now Massoni's brother leapt out
among the rocks, bounding like a wild goat
from point to point, until one of the many
shots fired at him took effect, and he fell
dead upon the hill-side.
</p>

<p>
Arrighi, however, remained within, and
when, at length, after much hesitation,
some of the gendarmes dared to enter the
cave where lay hid the dreaded bandit, he
was nowhere to be found.
</p>

<p>
All night was the silent watch kept; but
when, early in the morning, some of the
soldiers moved off to a neighbouring spring
for water, two shots, fired suddenly from
the mysterious cavern, struck through the
heart two of their number; and the party
who went to fetch in their dead bodies lost
another man from the same fatal gun.
</p>

<p>
It was of no use to fire madly into the
rocky cavern, the prisoner remained uninjured
and undiscoverable.
</p>

<p>
After waiting another day or two, and
vainly endeavouring to smoke their enemy
out of his concealment, an engineer with
other officials were sent for from Corte, and
it was arranged that the cave should be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_103' name='Page_103'>[103]</a></span>
blown up by gunpowder. The desperate
man inside, for whose death, just though it
certainly was, it seemed pitiful to think that
the assistance of so many of his fellow-creatures
should be required, overheard the
proposal, and resolved at last to take
flight.
</p>

<p>
He waited, however, for night, when,
under cover of the darkness, he escaped
from his hiding-place. He had already got
away to some distance when a ball hit him
in the leg; but, with the despair of the
hunted animal, he struggled on, leaving a
bloody trail upon the ground as he passed.
</p>

<p>
When morning dawned, the gendarmes
found the outlaw, who for years had been
their terror and the object of their pursuit,
lying faint and exhausted among the rocks.
Yet, even then, they feared to approach
too near the dying brave, and creeping
up cautiously, they fired upon him whilst
yet he was unconscious of their approach,
and in another moment Arrighi lay upon
the slope of Monte Rotondo, a dead man.
</p>

<p>
The next day the bodies of six men&mdash;three
bandits and three soldiers&mdash;were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_104' name='Page_104'>[104]</a></span>
carried in a sad procession down the hill-side
to the plain below, and the French Government
was rid of three of the most celebrated
and intrepid of Corsican bandits.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_105' name='Page_105'>[105]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">SOME MORE ABOUT BANDITS.</span>
</h2>

<p>
Some of the Corsican bandits have been, not
only objects of admiration, but of love, to
their fellow-countrymen in general, who
willingly contributed to their support. Even
if their first adoption of lawless life were
not due to their dislike of a foreign government&mdash;for
long not quite palatable to the
free wild people of the interior&mdash;yet their
after-life consisted of a series of skirmishes
against, and contests with, a police towards
whom the majority of the islanders owed
some grudge or other. One of the most
celebrated of these men, and one who
became, in the eyes of his own people, a
hero of romance, was a bandit of the name
of Teodoro, who lived at the commencement
of the present century.
</p>

<p>
Teodoro became a bandit, not from any
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_106' name='Page_106'>[106]</a></span>
private quarrel, or from fear of the consequences
of any deed of violence, but to
escape joining the ranks of the French
soldiery, by whom he had been somewhat
roughly seized and enrolled amongst their
number.
</p>

<p>
The young Corsican had no objection to
a warlike occupation, but he did not choose
to lose his liberty, nor had he any wish to
fight for the masters of his country.
</p>

<p>
So he escaped to the mountains, by his
daring spirit and love of adventure becoming
at once the terror of his enemies and
the darling of his countrymen.
</p>

<p>
He called himself King of the Mountains,
and imposed taxes upon the villagers around
to keep up his state; but they were grudged
by few, for the king was handsome, fascinating,
and generous. His life was full of
wild, bloody, and romantic incidents; but
meanness was never connected with his
name. He was a staunch friend, and even
a forgiving foe. His companions, besides
his queen, were an uncle named Angellone,
and another bandit called Brusco.
</p>

<p>
Brusco and Teodoro were bound together
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_107' name='Page_107'>[107]</a></span>
by the ties of a tender friendship, but this
friendship was the cause of secret jealousy
to Angellone. One day a quarrel took
place in Teodoro's absence, and the elder
man murdered his nephew's friend, then
escaping to the maquins.
</p>

<p>
Teodoro, heart-broken at the loss of
Brusco, swore a furious oath to avenge him
at the hands of his murderer. According
to ancient fashion, he began to let his beard
grow, as a solemn witness to this oath.
</p>

<p>
But not for long. The murderer could
not long escape his pursuing hand, and ere
long the King of the Mountains re-appeared
with a smooth chin.
</p>

<p>
Teodoro shared the usual fate of the outlaw.
He was betrayed, whilst lying ill in
his mountain home, to the gendarmes, who
showed little mercy to the dying man.
Sick though he was, however, he fought
even then to the death, and laid two of his
assailants low, before his arms fell motionless
and his proud spirit succumbed to the
last of his foes.
</p>

<p>
It is reported that, after his death, some
of the villagers came up the hill-side, and,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_108' name='Page_108'>[108]</a></span>
under the influence of love or fear to the
memory of the famous bandit, offered the
contributions due to the King of the Mountains
towards the support of his queen and
her infant child.
</p>

<p>
Probably of a different stamp was a young
brigand whose execution at Bastia, in the
summer of 1852, is so pitifully described by
Gregorovius in his book on Corsica, himself
being an eye-witness of part of the scene.
</p>

<p>
He was but three and twenty, beautiful
of face, strong as a lion, and brave and
fierce as a wild beast; but the accusation
against him was that he had murdered ten
men out of "caprice"!
</p>

<p>
What an extraordinary madness must that
have been which incited this poor young
Corsican, probably from no reason but the
insensate lust of blood, for no purposes of
robbery or even adequate anger, to murder
his fellow-men!
</p>

<p>
The very unnaturalness of the phenomenon
arouses pity from those whose
bringing-up makes such a wild-beast madness
incomprehensible to them. One
wonders in what atmosphere poor Bracciamozzo
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_109' name='Page_109'>[109]</a></span>
had been reared&mdash;whether he had
been brought up in the bandit's cave,
accustomed to sights of brutal ferocity and
the indulgence of every fierce passion, and
growing up to find his hand against every
man.
</p>

<p>
This was the probable commencement of
a life which, at three and twenty, was to
end stained by so much crime. That the
young brigand was all bad, it is impossible
to believe, reading Gregorovius'
account.
</p>

<p>
Death was no terrible stranger to him;
he had been accustomed to its pale face
from boyhood, and he was not likely to
flinch even before its more horrible appearance
on the public scaffold.
</p>

<p>
With his one arm bound behind his back
(for he had lost the other in a fight with
the gendarmes), he walked to his death
firmly and quietly. There was no vulgar
air of braggadocio about him, no attempt
to excite any momentary popular sympathy
by dramatic means. He died unflinchingly,
not as a hero, but as a penitent, acknowledging
his black deeds. "I pray God and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_110' name='Page_110'>[110]</a></span>
the world for forgiveness," said the young
murderer, with native brevity, on the
scaffold, "for I acknowledge that I have
done much evil."
</p>

<p>
I will not here stop to speak of the Bella
Coschia brothers, the last two bandits
whose wild deeds have made them famous
in Corsica. They are yet alive, and not
much beyond middle age; but their history
belongs to another part of the island, where
I heard much of them.
</p>

<p>
I must close this chapter with a dirge, or
<i>vocero</i>, roughly translated from the Corsican
patois, and which was improvised at the
funeral of a bandit called Canino, some
years ago.
</p>

<p>
These voceri are one of the peculiarities
of Corsica. Until quite lately, it was constantly
the custom, at the funeral of any
great or popular person, or, indeed, over
the coffin of any man, woman, or child
whose death was due to accident, murder,
or any sudden and terrible circumstance,
for the nearest of kin (usually the sister or
mother of the dead person) to break out
into some impromptu song of lamentation,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_111' name='Page_111'>[111]</a></span>
couched in rude but often stirring
verse.
</p>

<p>
These mournful dirges were striking in
their rugged but earnest simplicity; and
fortunately some of them have been preserved
and printed at Ajaccio.
</p>

<p>
The custom of singing the vocero, like
most other ancient and romantic customs,
is now, however, slowly but surely dying
out in the island.

<h2>
CHAPTER IX.
<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">CORTE AND ITS HOTEL.</span>
</h2>

<p>
From Ponte alle Lecchia the road follows
the course of the foaming river Vecchio for
a long way, along a wide valley, where the
green hills circling round are somewhat
monotonous for a time, but presently turn
into handsome grey and white limestone
cliffs, hanging in one place in wild and
curious peaks above the passing carriage.
</p>

<p>
After the large village of Cabouralino,
the scenery becomes tamer again, the ground
more cultivated, flocks of black and white
silky haired goats with silvery bells passing
us constantly.
</p>

<p>
The road, too, was here alive with men
riding mules, and leading after them by a
cord a string of other mules with packs on
their backs. It was a matter of difficulty
to pass some of these mules, who were not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_117' name='Page_117'>[117]</a></span>
accustomed to "carriage company," and
who backed towards the precipice occasionally,
kicking wildly, to the discomfiture
of their owners.
</p>

<p>
This part of the country was the scene of
the battle of Ponte Nuovo, in 1769, the last
battle fought for Corsican independence;
and the date from which Corsica became
a French province. It has a touching
interest for this reason, and on account of
its being a witness to the last vain effort
of Paoli in his country's cause.
</p>

<p>
But now we were leaving the river, with
its foaming waters and its bloody memories,
over which the fine thoughtful face of
Pasquale Paoli seemed to cast a humanizing
influence, and were ascending the
mountains under a blue sky.
</p>

<p>
Vast quantities of handsome hellebore,
with large ball-like clumps of flowers, and
of a species of pale green spurge (its flowers
like a number of yellow caterpillars attached
to the stem), grew by the roadside; ilex-trees
scattered themselves up and down
rocks of every form and height, above and
below the road, and the mountains all
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_118' name='Page_118'>[118]</a></span>
round us became more and more covered
with snow. Here and there were placed
villages in lofty and commanding situations;
one especially, named Suaria,
which was perched just above us on a
conical green hill rising from the road-side.
The village was partially hidden by firs and
ilexes crowning this pretty eminence; but
the high four-storied campanile of Suaria
Church stood out, white and imposing,
above their sheltering branches. Very cold
and frosty was the wind, notwithstanding
the brilliant sun, as we reached the summit
of the pass; but the view of mountain
scenery spread out beneath us was magnificent.
</p>

<p>
And now we began our descent through
many a tree-covered hill, towards Corte,
its high, red-tiled houses visible miles
before we reached it. Corte, the central
inland town of Corsica, is, after Bastia and
Ajaccio, the largest town in the island, and
has a position unequalled for wild beauty.
</p>

<p>
It lies in the very heart of the wildest
mountains of Corsica, surrounded on every
side by their gaunt and precipitous flanks.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_119' name='Page_119'>[119]</a></span>
Monte Rotondo, one of the highest of the
inland chain, raises its snow-crowned head
to look over the solemn blue-grey hills immediately
behind Corte; and two broad
foaming rivers dash down the gully beside
the town, and unite, after passing under
their handsome stone bridges, in the narrow
valley just beneath.
</p>

<p>
Corte is itself at no mean height above
the sea level; and, at the time of our
first visit, was exceedingly cold, with a
sharp north wind rushing through the town
from the numerous mountain ravines.
</p>

<p>
The citadel, which of itself is not much,
is built, with extraordinarily picturesque
effect, upon the summit of a precipitous
hill, rising from the midst of the town; up
whose sides run a few houses, until the
overhanging rocks force them to give place
to the prickly pear. The main streets in
Corte are wide, and paved with rough stone,
with enormously high, factory-like houses,
of seven or even eight stories, on each side.
The houses are remarkably hideous, even
for Corsica; built of dirty white stone, and
red roofed, without any eaves, the windows
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_120' name='Page_120'>[120]</a></span>
irregular and poor, and the open doorways
(into large buildings) often showing dirty
and poverty-stricken interiors.
</p>

<p>
Very steep side streets, impassable for
carriages, and sometimes giving place to
a series of stone steps, lead up into the
higher parts of the town, and towards the
citadel and church.
</p>

<p>
Fine elm-trees make a nice avenue all
up the main road, at the end of which are
the two respectable hotels of Corte, Hotels
Pierracci and Paoli, so precisely opposite
that the rival guests can look into each
other's windows.
</p>

<p>
If it were not for its dirt, and its ugly
houses, the beauty of Corte would be almost
unrivalled in European scenery. How one
sighs in Corsica for the lovely grey cottages
with broad eaves, and for the stately art-decorated
mansions with graceful towers, of
beauty-loving Italy!
</p>

<p>
No such thing is to be seen here. I
doubt if, from one end of Corsica to the
other, there is one building with any pretensions
to real architectural beauty.
</p>

<p>
Art has never been much cultivated in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_121' name='Page_121'>[121]</a></span>
the island. A people who for centuries
have lived in a condition of incessant warfare
and personal insecurity have but little
time or inclination to indulge in the peaceful
pursuits of their more luxurious neighbours;
and Corsican architecture partakes
of the Corsican character, being stern,
rugged, and primitive. Many a village,
nestled in some exquisite situation among
snow-capped hills and orange groves, we
found perfectly ruined, in an artistic point
of view, by its ugly dwellings.
</p>

<p>
The churches are the only redeeming
feature in Corsican architecture. Their
campaniles, or bell-towers, are generally
lofty and picturesque, divided into several
stories, and standing apart from the body
of the church.
</p>

<p>
Hotel Pierracci, which had been recommended
to us, we found a fair hotel in
many respects, but intensely national in
its peculiarities. The despotic Briton,
coming straight from club luxuries and
obsequious attentions, would feel himself
decidedly out of place there, and not a little
miserable.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_122' name='Page_122'>[122]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
It is a large hotel, with two handsome
dining-rooms, and spacious, well-furnished
bedrooms; and although the broad stone
staircase is somewhat odoriferous and the
passages not over clean, yet the rooms are
comfortable and perfectly above suspicion.
</p>

<p>
But, for the whole of this large establishment,
generally well filled with a constantly
changing series of guests, there appeared
to be only one terribly overworked young
waiter, and an elderly maid of all work, (exclusive
of the kitchen department).
</p>

<p>
The result was, that even if you had that
un-Corsican luxury of a bell in your room,
which was not often, its repeated calls
were unheeded; and you had speedily to
learn and put in practice that great law
of uncivilized regions, "If you want anything
done, do it yourself."
</p>

<p>
As, however, every domestic was in a
gasping hurry, and the big landlady&mdash;a
mixture of sudden irascibility and occasional
benevolence&mdash;was apt to regard your wants
as puerile, and, Corsican fashion, to tell
you so loudly to your face&mdash;a foray in
dressing-gown and slippers to the kitchen,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_123' name='Page_123'>[123]</a></span>
after hot water, or cleaned boots, or any
other necessity of man and woman, was
apt to end in ignominy and the trial of
English tempers. The crockery and cutlery
of Hotel Pierracci also run notably short.
</p>

<p>
It was a current joke amongst the English
visitors, that the one coffee-pot of the
establishment not only supplied all the
numerous breakfast-tables of the different
guests, but also did duty on occasions for
shaving and toilette water. And this fact
I can believe; for one morning, having by
persistent obstinacy triumphed over the
difficulties of obtaining a little hot water
for dressing purposes, my tin jug was
fetched away almost immediately afterwards,
and I was astonished to see it reappearing
on the breakfast table ten minutes
later in its habitual guise of coffee-pot.
</p>

<p>
At breakfast this same coffee-pot was the
cause of continual contention between the
worried little waiter and ourselves. When
it pleased him to give us our breakfast, he
used to run in, fill our cups hastily, and
whisk out again with his precious pot; and
no entreaties or commands would persuade
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_124' name='Page_124'>[124]</a></span>
him to leave that invaluable and useful
little metal jug behind him, or even to
return with it and refill our cups. I think
there was a bond of sympathy between that
waiter and his coffee-pot, both so terribly
overworked.
</p>

<p>
The food at Hotel Pierracci was good, but
rather scarce, and it was difficult to make
a dinner off the microscopic scraps which
adorned the dishes during the eight courses
of the table d'hôte. We noticed this particularly
on our road home again, when
perhaps our long stay in mountain air and
the fine Corsican climate had increased
our correct English appetites to a country
voracity. But, on the whole, for Corsica,
Hotel Pierracci may be considered a very
comfortable hotel; and, excepting that at
Sartene, which is also a good one, has the
reputation of being almost the only large
and handsome hotel out of Ajaccio.
</p>

<p>
Hotel Paoli, we were told afterwards by
some French acquaintances, was clean and
well ordered, with good rooms and very
moderate charges; but we did not go inside
the place.

<h2>
CHAPTER X.
<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">AN ENCOUNTER WITH STREET URCHINS.</span>
</h2>

<p>
Corte has one terrible drawback&mdash;nay, two:
its extreme dirt and its impudent children.
</p>

<p>
I have heard it said that the position of
the town gives it the advantage of being
both a good summer and winter residence,
the climate being never too hot or too cold.
</p>

<p>
It may never be too hot, but it must
undoubtedly be a very cold place in winter,
from its elevation among the numerous
snow mountains that surround it. This, of
course, is a matter of taste. But I should
doubt extremely its being in any degree
healthy in summer.
</p>

<p>
I heard vague rumours of malaria whilst
we were there; and I should not doubt the
existence of fever in the hot weather.
</p>

<p>
I have been in a good many German,
Italian, and Corsican towns; but not one
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_126' name='Page_126'>[126]</a></span>
of them can vie with Corte in uncleanliness.
Corte, I should think, would carry off the
palm in filthy pavements, and putrid odours,
from any town in Europe.
</p>

<p>
It was only the beginning of June when
we visited it for the second time, and yet
there were certain streets, and those not
insignificant ones, where it was absolutely
necessary to hold one's nose and run.
</p>

<p>
As there were waste rubbish places in
many of these parts, which were nothing
at all but open drains, and receptacles for
everything horrid that could be thrown
upon them from the windows and balconies
of the houses around, the objectionable
odours were neither astonishing nor unaccountable.
</p>

<p>
As regards the children of Corte, they
are no small drawback to the delights of
the place.
</p>

<p>
The inhabitants are altogether a rough,
uncivil set, far less courteous than the
generality of Corsicans, and have had an
evil reputation amongst strangers for many
years.
</p>

<p>
It is not conducive to the enjoyment of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_127' name='Page_127'>[127]</a></span>
beautiful scenery or a quiet stroll, to be
surrounded down the street, and followed
far into the country by a mocking, shouting
horde of dancing dervishes, not content
with roaring out "Inglesé! Inglesé!" with
unceasing energy, but making occasional
clutches at your dress or umbrella, and
stopping up the public way.
</p>

<p>
The ingenious youth of Corte has one
especial diversion, retained for the delectation
of the stranger. This consists in holding
a stout piece of cord across the road,
barring the path, with the shouted intimation,
"No pennies, no passage!" or, in
their own words, "Sou, sou, Inglese!"
</p>

<p>
English pride naturally determines that
its owner will die sooner than bestow the
required penny on these little pests;
but this righteous wrath sometimes entails
unpleasant results. An acquaintance of
ours, then at Corte, had, a few weeks
before, been nearly mobbed by the elder
part of the community when he attempted
to cut the rope and offered to thrash the
children. We ourselves came in for an unpleasant
encounter, that might have ended
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_128' name='Page_128'>[128]</a></span>
awkwardly. We were taking a walk across
the valley of the Tavignano, where it rushes,
boiling and foaming in splendid cascades
over its green and grey boulders, past the
city, before joining the equally picturesque
river Restonico.
</p>

<p>
It was Sunday evening; and, unfortunately,
we had chosen a time when all the
juvenile populace were out of school, and
on the look-out for a little innocent amusement.
</p>

<p>
I have noticed that a demoniac phase
often comes over naughty children on a
Sunday evening. Be that as it may, a
troop of about twenty, chiefly boys, pursued
us unrelentingly far outside the precincts of
the town, shouting their war-cry of "Sou,
Inglese!" and running round and round till
we could neither see the views, nor hear
ourselves speak.
</p>

<p>
A rope which they stretched across the
road for the customary pastime fortunately
broke, and we passed on through the gap;
but the broken remains, held by two youthful
fiends, served as an instrument of
torture wherewith to wind us up and hopelessly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_129' name='Page_129'>[129]</a></span>
confuse our footsteps. Human endurance
could bear no more; and, after one
or two stern warnings, No. 3, whose wrath
had been gradually gathering, suddenly saw
her opportunity, and, darting upon two
small tormentors before they could escape,
she brought down her umbrella upon their
degenerate backs with as much force as
nature had supplied to her.
</p>

<p>
Instantly, the attitude of these juvenile
Corsicans changed. They had been disporting
themselves before: now they prepared
for serious warfare. There was a
moment's pause; and then a volley of
sharp stones came after us.
</p>

<p>
We walked on quickly, but the charge
increased instead of decreasing, one striking
No. 2 on the head, and another No. 3 on
the heel, but fortunately without inflicting
any serious damage.
</p>

<p>
But flint stones from off a roadside are
not pleasing weapons; and things might
have ended badly for us, but for a sudden
diversion.
</p>

<p>
From a cottage by the roadside just
before us, dashed out three big boys, all
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_130' name='Page_130'>[130]</a></span>
over the humanizing age of thirteen; and,
undertaking our defence without a word,
they made a sudden onslaught upon our
pursuers, and in two minutes had put them
all to flight.
</p>

<p>
We were really relieved, and thanked the
knights-errant warmly. Two of them, boys
of about fourteen or fifteen, had pipes in
their mouths; and one of them, a young
man a year or two older, remarked
sagely, that it was always thus with visitors:
<span lang="fr_FR">"Les enfants de Corte étaient terriblement
méchants."</span>
</p>

<p>
Having bade adieu to our gallant defenders,
we were walking on, and had
almost forgotten them, when the noise of
a terrific struggling and scuffling behind us
again attracted our attention.
</p>

<p>
Our friends had got a boy of about eleven
between them, and were dragging him
along by the arms by main force.
</p>

<p>
The boy was resisting with all his power,
and was being dragged along almost double,
his bare feet scraping the ground in a vain
effort not to move, whilst he sobbed and
shouted in a passion of rage and terror very
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_131' name='Page_131'>[131]</a></span>
unbecoming in one of his heroic race. He
was a ragged, dirty, pretty urchin, with
large brown eyes, and a wicked face that
prophesied for him bigger scrapes some day
than stone-throwing.
</p>

<p>
The two boys who had him in custody
brought the unfortunate imp to our astonished
feet, and rested there; still gripping
him fast, and demanding our good pleasure
concerning his chastisement.
</p>

<p>
<span lang="fr_FR">"Tenez, mademoiselle,"</span> said the third,
holding up a big pointed stone, <span lang="fr_FR">"voilà
la pierre qu'il a jetée!"</span> Circumstantial
evidence with a vengeance; the culprit
confronted with the instrument of his
iniquity!
</p>

<p>
Perhaps we were weak; but we forgave
that terror-stricken boy (who, I verily believe,
expected some vendetta-like vengeance
at our hands), and he was allowed to slink
off with an admonition from us to "do so
no more."
</p>

<p>
Coming back, these same big boys again
overtook us; and, quietly remarking that
they would see us safe home, they escorted
us to the door of our hotel with much polite
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_132' name='Page_132'>[132]</a></span>
conversation, and then made off, raising
their caps.
</p>

<p>
These boys were in the lower ranks of
life, although decently dressed; but it
would have been an insult to offer them any
recompense. Their action proceeded from
chivalry <span lang="fr_FR">"pur et simple,"</span> and they had no
notion of any reward.
</p>

<p>
Weeks afterwards, when two of us returned
to Corte, a smiling face suddenly
attracted our attention in the streets one
day, and we recognized one of our boyish
defenders. Of course we greeted him, and
he lifted his cap, remarking, "I have seen
<i>you</i> for the last half hour."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_133' name='Page_133'>[133]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
CHAPTER XI.
<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">MANNERS AND CUSTOMS AT CORTE.</span>
</h2>

<p>
A good deal of historical interest is attached
to Corte. From the earliest times it has
been the seat of the national government,
and the centre of the more important
popular demonstrations. The old town and
citadel have undergone more sieges and
been worn by more numerous assaults than
even Calvi or Bonifacio.
</p>

<p>
Here Paoli lived, and, from his modest
home, regulated the government of his
country; and here was the home of the
patriot Gaffori.
</p>

<p>
An anecdote is told in connection with
the latter which is truly Corsican in its
Spartan-like heroism.
</p>

<p>
It was in 1746, during one of the ceaseless
conflicts with Genoa, and Gaffori was storming
the city. He had already made much
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_134' name='Page_134'>[134]</a></span>
progress, and the Genoese commander was
beginning to tremble for the fate of his fort.
Suddenly the Corsican firing ceased, and
every gun was silent, whilst the islanders
gazed horror-struck on the walls. Upon
them was bound the young son of Gaffori,
who had been taken prisoner, and whom
the Genoese general had commanded to be
placed there in order to deter the successful
storming party, or as a mark for his
father's guns.
</p>

<p>
Gaffori paused a moment; but only a
moment. In another minute he gave the
order, and the assault continued.
</p>

<p>
But the heroic father had his reward.
The breach was made, Corte fell, and
Gaffori's son was rescued unhurt from his
perilous situation.
</p>

<p>
Corte abounds in pointer dogs. Paoli
had his six canine friends, who kept house
with him at Corte; but tradition tells not
whether they, too, were pointers or no.
</p>

<p>
The men of Corte struck me as being a
finer race physically than any other in the
island. They are tall and well-made, with
upright figures.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_135' name='Page_135'>[135]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Corsicans, in face and figure, are more
akin to the English than the Italians: there
is none of the soft roundness of the Italian
about them; they are bony, manly, and
muscular.
</p>

<p>
But the Cortéans appeared to me to excel
even their other compatriots in idleness. As
one of themselves said, "The young men of
Corte do nothing but walk the streets from
morning till night, and all they have to
occupy them is to think of evil."
</p>

<p>
The Corsican women, however, at Corte
as elsewhere, are essentially domestic and
retiring. Flaunting and finery have not
yet become the fashion among these simple-hearted
daughters of Eve; and as long as
their lords require it of them, they will
probably remain the same light-hearted,
energetic, hard-working family supporters
that they now are.
</p>

<p>
To them may be applied, with great
accuracy, the old rhyme:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">
"Good wives, like city clocks, should be
</p>
<p>
Exact with regularity;
</p>
<p>
Yet not, like city clocks so loud,
</p>
<p>
Be heard by all the vulgar crowd.
</p>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_136' name='Page_136'>[136]</a></span>
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">
"Good wives to snails should be akin,
</p>
<p>
Always their houses keep within,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
Yet not to carry (fashion's hacks)
</p>
<p>
All they possess upon their backs."
</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
The only occasion on which the women
of Corsica appear to have an outing is on
Sunday morning, after early Mass, when, in
their neat attire of black and white, they
sometimes take a quiet turn up and down
the main street or place.
</p>

<p>
A funeral, too, may bring them out. On
passing through Olmeto some weeks afterwards,
we met half a dozen women coming
down the road together, dressed rather more
gaily than usual; and our driver immediately
remarked, "There must be a funeral in
Olmeto, or the women would not be out."
</p>

<p>
"But," we asked, "do they not put on
mourning for the occasion?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh no; only the relatives do that."
</p>

<p>
"But," we said, "there are so many people
always dressed in black in Corsica; how is
that?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, people only go into mourning for
a very near relation; but the first time they
wear it for three or four years, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_137' name='Page_137'>[137]</a></span>
second time, unless they are young children,
for the rest of their life."
</p>

<p>
This accounts for the number of sombre
female figures one sees in this island, the
black handkerchief which is worn over the
head rendering them peculiarly funereal-looking;
and explains why you never meet
an elderly woman in any other attire.
</p>

<p>
But the group of women we met were
evidently only acquaintances or distant
relations of the dead, for their costume
was more than usually lively, one or two
of them wearing a blue or orange head-gear
and other unaccustomed bits of finery. The
ceremony appeared to them, no doubt, in
the light of an agreeable dissipation, as it
did to a certain poor Welshwoman of my
acquaintance, who remarked, cheerfully, that
"Mother had a' been quite gay lately; she'd
a' been to three funerals last week!"
</p>

<p>
The church at Corte is in the higher part
of the town, surrounded by narrow streets
and houses that have lain in ruins ever
since the last bombardment of the town.
It is not a pretentious building, either within
or without.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_138' name='Page_138'>[138]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Poor paintings and gaudy images of saints
bedecked every side altar, and a highly
coloured Madonna stood in a niche on either
side of the principal altar, where the tall
candles shed artificial sunlight on beautiful
but badly arranged flowers.
</p>

<p>
The service was mumbled through by an
old priest, less to our edification than apparently
to that of the reverent crowd of
women worshippers who filled the building.
</p>

<p>
Scarcely a man was to be seen in church.
Their Sunday duties appeared to consist in
squatting in rows just outside the porch,
smoking their pipes, and watching the
entrance of their better halves.
</p>

<p>
In Corsica the men are not church-goers.
Coming from North Italy, where the congregations
are composed more of men than of
women, one cannot fail to be struck by this
fact.
</p>

<p>
Fillipini remarks of his countrymen that
they are a religious community. He would
scarcely say so now. French influence and
French scepticism are already making themselves
felt among the Corsican men; and
the priesthood on the island does not appear
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_139' name='Page_139'>[139]</a></span>
sufficiently strong, as a body, intellectually
or morally, to preserve their fading influence.
But the men in Corte, although
they may not care to go to church, yet are
sufficiently orthodox to join in a good procession
on St. Joseph's Day.
</p>

<p>
It was about five o'clock in the evening,
when the sound of distant chanting and the
hum of many voices drew us to the window.
</p>

<p>
There we saw, coming up the road under
the elm trees, a troop of about sixty or
seventy men and women, carrying banners
and dressed in uniform.
</p>

<p>
First came the women, of whom there
were not altogether more than about a
dozen.
</p>

<p>
They were dressed in a pretty costume
of bright blue skirt, white head kerchief,
and round white cape, trimmed with blue,
and they carried in their midst a banner
"with a strange device," that we could not
make out.
</p>

<p>
Then came men, in white shirts and
trowsers, with white head-gear something
between a cap and a turban, and green
capes.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_140' name='Page_140'>[140]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Then more men, with white attire and
crimson capes. These capes evidently
differed according to the relative wealth of
the wearer, for some were of crimson silk
edged with gold, and some of simple calico.
These carried a large crucifix.
</p>

<p>
Finally came a troop with rich purple
capes. These were carrying, with some
difficulty, an immense statue of St. Joseph,
gilt all over, and surrounded by a gold
frame. Four of the men bore the image on
stout poles, whilst a fifth held it straight in
the centre.
</p>

<p>
This troop was evidently the "picked
lot" of the procession, for they chanted,
as they walked, an extraordinary dirge-like
chant, and were accompanied by a few
priests in black cassocks, likewise singing.
</p>

<p>
I have seldom seen anything much more
picturesque than that gay procession, as it
wound with its banners under the shady
avenue, and up the hill-side towards the
little church, now lost, now seen, between
the narrow crooked streets, the weird chant
dying and rising by turns on the quiet
evening air.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_141' name='Page_141'>[141]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Everything solemn, however, has its
travesty, I imagine, and children always
reproduce in their games what has most impressed
them.
</p>

<p>
So, an hour or two later, when the twilight
was falling, and the faithful were
mostly in church, there came the parody of
the afternoon's procession.
</p>

<p>
Hearing a prodigious drumming, and the
shouts of children, I looked out and saw a
collection of about twenty or thirty of the
ragged barefoot urchins of Corte, promenading
the street in solemn procession, shouting
a song that I fear was profane, at the top of
their voices, drumming energetically with
an old spoon upon a broken brass can that
they had evidently picked up from the roadside,
and following the lead of a bold-faced,
pretty boy, who bore aloft the seedy remains
of a large wooden cross, which had apparently
been previously used in church decoration,
as it still showed the remnants of withered
moss and evergreens.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_142' name='Page_142'>[142]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
CHAPTER XII.
<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">SAN ROCCO BY THE RESTONICO.</span>
</h2>

<p>
The environs of Corte abound in lovely
walks. Surrounded as it is by mountain,
ravine, and river, this is no wonder. Certainly,
one not easily rivalled, is to be found
in the valley of the Restonico, one of the
two rivers which rush seething and boiling
just below the town.
</p>

<p>
We strolled into this beautiful vale quite
by accident, after hastily skirting the
streets, to avoid those "horrid boys." The
road, which was rough but broad, wound
for miles through a narrow gorge, bordered
on both sides by the wildest and steepest
walls of rock, at the bottom of which
swirled, in mingled white foam and malachite
green, over a boulder-strewn bed, the busy
Restonico.
</p>

<p>
The rocks upon the opposite side especially
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_143' name='Page_143'>[143]</a></span>
were inaccessibly steep, and appeared about
five hundred feet high; but were in places
clothed by rich herbage, and, here and
there, wherever their straight sides sloped
a little, covered by thick groves of chestnut
trees.
</p>

<p>
The road itself was shaded in parts by
the great crags that hung overhead, and in
parts by avenues of chestnuts; while many
a gurgling little stream rushed down the
hill-side and ran merrily across our path.
In front, filling up the end of the gorge,
sometimes hidden by massive rocks or sudden
luxuriance of foliage, rose the stately
white head of Monte Rotondo.
</p>

<p>
Looking back, the town of Corte rose
from amongst its coronal of hills with beautiful
effect, the long cross-topped church
spire pointing faintly into the bright blue
sky, and the white citadel on its strange
precipitous eminence, peering, as it seemed,
into heaven itself.
</p>

<p>
It was one of the hottest days we had felt
in Corsica, and, beautiful though the walk
was, it was almost pain to hurry, umbrella
in hand, from one shady spot to another.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_144' name='Page_144'>[144]</a></span>
If ever snakes would stand upon their tips
and dance in the sun together, as our driver
once informed us he had seen them do, it
would have been to-day! The lizards on
the glaring walls seemed countless; and,
wherever the glare was intensest, there the
little green husband and brown wife basked
together in loving enjoyment.
</p>

<p>
Very thankful were we at last to sit down
on some large boulders beside the rushing
waters, where a grove of thickly growing
chestnuts threw a grateful shade around.
The river here had thrown up quite a little
shore of gravel, now partially grassed over
with soft green turf; and the chestnut pods
of last summer almost covered the ground
at our feet.
</p>

<p>
At a short distance from us, stood, on
a little grassy plain, beneath a blighted tree
trunk, a tiny chapel, about six feet high
and two feet wide, containing a golden
image of the Madonna.
</p>

<p>
It had the appearance of a doll's house,
and somehow looked out of place beside
that wide, wild, tumultuous river. This
was about two miles out of Corte; but,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_145' name='Page_145'>[145]</a></span>
considerably nearer the town, is a much
more singular chapel.
</p>

<p>
Chapel, perhaps, is scarcely the word for
it, since it is only a species of box, or
square hole, formed by nature or blasting,
in a large block of solid rock by the roadside.
The hole is about three feet square
and deep, and is glassed over in front.
Inside this strange little tabernacle is a
highly coloured, well-modelled figure of a
man, with one of his trouser-legs turned up
to show a remarkably life-like wound on the
knee, to which he draws the attention of
the passer-by with a pathetic countenance.
A dog, looking rather ashamed of himself,
stands beside the pilgrim and completes
the group.
</p>

<p>
This individual is, we are informed, San
Rocco of rather obscure memory, and
beneath the tabernacle is the following
inscription, cut into the rock:&mdash;<span lang="it_IT">"Fermati,
Passegioro, e prega intanto se vuoi l'assistanza
di San Rocco."</span>
</p>

<p>
The little white oratory fixed in the huge
glaring rock, with the tiny stone steps
beside it, and the Restonico roaring beneath
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_146' name='Page_146'>[146]</a></span>
it, would have been a picturesque
sight to English eyes, had it not been that
the figure within reminded one irresistibly
and most unpleasantly of our late tormentors,
the Italian beggars, with their
officiously displayed surgical horrors.
</p>

<p>
According to Baring-Gould, in his "Lives
of the Saints," San Rocco, or Saint Roch,
was a rather mythical personage. All
that is authentic about him is that he was
a Frenchman, a native of Montpellier, who
went on a pilgrimage to Rome, and, on his
return, not being recognized, was taken up
as a spy, and died miserably in the common
gaol. He was of good family and some
means (which he forsook for the sake of
his pilgrimage), and died about the year
<span class='smcap'>A.D.</span> 1350. Legend adds, that whilst in
Italy, where the plague at this time was
raging, he miraculously cured thousands by
making over them the sign of the cross,
until himself attacked; when, creeping into
a miserable hovel, he was supplied by a
friendly dog with necessary food. An angel
subsequently touched him upon the thigh,
from which place the plague boil rose and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_147' name='Page_147'>[147]</a></span>
burst. When dying in the Montpellier
prison, St. Roch prayed that all invoking
him should be henceforth delivered from the
plague; and an angel appeared with the
written promise that his patronage should
prove the perfect cure of all suffering from
this scourge.
</p>

<p>
In several of representations St. Roch
an angel is seen beside him, touching his
thigh, and the dog also sometimes carries a
loaf in his mouth.
</p>

<p>
It was just beginning to cool a little
when we were forced to turn homewards.
Monte Rotondo was growing grander and
nearer, the path was more lovely, and the
chestnut woods thick and shady; but all
these charms, alas! had to give way to the
claims of the six o'clock table d'hôte at
Hotel Pierracci. The return walk was
delicious, and the fashionable hour of promenade
had evidently just commenced; for
we began to meet family groups taking
their evening stroll together up the hitherto
deserted gorge. Just where a lofty cypress,
stem and solitary, lifted up its dark, pointed
head high into the deep blue sky, to mark
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_148' name='Page_148'>[148]</a></span>
the presence of a tiny cemetery upon the
steep hill-side above us, the sun suddenly
fell behind Corte's framework of hills, and
we re-entered the baking streets in early
shadow.
</p>

<p>
At the doorway of the hotel a very tall
sentry stood at arms; for we had the
honour of housing a general beneath our
roof.
</p>

<p>
This general was a very grand person.
At dinner-time his rank and dignity obliged
him to have a table to himself, where he
sat eating his chicken and salad in solitary
grandeur and profound silence. I was
really sorry for the poor general; for he
was young and good-looking, and seemed
intended by nature and his own inclinations
(as evinced by sundry half-wistful glances
towards the large table, where we, the
common herd, dined in unpretending sociability),
for a more agreeable and gregarious
lot than the one forced upon him by the
claims of his exalted position.
</p>

<p>
It was very thrilling, however, to see our
<i>militaire</i> receive his letters in the morning.
The sentry entered, musket on shoulder,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_149' name='Page_149'>[149]</a></span>
clanking through the salle à manger (for I
am ashamed to say this military grandee
had not a private sitting-room, or did not
use it); grounded arms, saluted, presented
the epistles from the extreme length of a
very stiff arm, and then stood motionless
at attention, an inanimate blue and red
human poker.
</p>

<p>
Tremendously hot though the day had
been, the evening was exceedingly chilly, and
we at last requested the morbid waiter to
light us a fire.
</p>

<p>
"What! cold?" he asked, incredulously.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said I, apologetically, "I am
afraid we are."
</p>

<p>
"Dear me, how strange it is! There are
you cold, and I quite warm. Women are
queer!"
</p>

<p>
"Well," said I, meekly, feeling quite
relieved that this was all the scolding I
was to receive; "you see, you work hard,
and we are sitting still; that makes the
difference."
</p>

<p>
"Si, si," said the little gloomy man, as
he blew at the wooden logs with good-natured
assiduity; "but you women are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_150' name='Page_150'>[150]</a></span>
always chilly. We men are stronger, that
is it." And he gave a final puff and positively
smiled.
</p>

<p>
We soon learnt that, in Corsica, the word
"lady" was an unknown quantity. Whenever,
solicitous of our dignity, we used it in
speaking of ourselves or companions, we
were generally corrected by the natives, and
the word "woman" substituted. "The
reason why I cannot tell;" for I fancy
Corsicans are above any petty democratic
pride of equality; and they usually behave
towards our sex with a kind courtesy that
is the evident offshoot of the old national
virtues of a brave and hospitable race.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_151' name='Page_151'>[151]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
CHAPTER XIII.
<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">A THIRTEEN HOURS' DRIVE.</span>
</h2>

<p>
At Corte we bade adieu to our not too
fascinating Bastia coachman; and the
journey to Ajaccio we performed by diligence.
</p>

<p>
The diligences that run between Corte
and Ajaccio are not numerous, nor very
convenient. Only one, going every other
day, has a good banquette. The daily diligence,
which is a poor stuffy little concern,
goes, by way of a Hibernianism, at ten
o'clock every night; and all the journey is
performed in the dark.
</p>

<p>
As we, however, came to see the country,
we waited for the "diligence de la Concurrence,"
as the best diligence is called, and
engaged the three banquette seats. And
very good ones they were, high up behind
the coachman's box, and completely open,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_152' name='Page_152'>[152]</a></span>
save for a hood which could be raised or
lowered at will. From this place we saw
the country well, and the seat was roomy
enough for three not very corpulent people.
</p>

<p>
It is a matter of some difficulty to discover
the facts about the Ajaccio diligences.
The hotels are in league with one or
another of them, and the result is a profound
ignorance concerning any but the
favoured vehicle, which is not conducive to
the comfort of the traveller.
</p>

<p>
For instance, Madame Pierracci unfortunately
favoured the stuffy and banquetteless
diligence; she therefore swore by
all her household gods that no other was in
existence, and that by no possibility could
we go at any other time, or by any other
conveyance than the night diligence. She
even denied the existence of any private
vehicles whatever, that would hold our
luggage, or more than two persons.
</p>

<p>
It was only after going out ourselves to
make inquiries, that we found that a man of
the name of Laurenz would supply a private
omnibus to Ajaccio and back for sixty francs;
and that M. Dionyse's <span lang="fr_FR">"diligence de la Concurrence,"</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_153' name='Page_153'>[153]</a></span>
of which the office was only a few
doors from the hotel, ran every other morning
to the capital. This is the best diligence
in Corsica; and, for the modest sum
of eleven francs, you may travel the twelve
hours in the banquette, behind very fair
horses.
</p>

<p>
We started about six a.m., changing
horses five times, and reaching Ajaccio at
seven in the evening; but the journey is
not generally so long.
</p>

<p>
It was an exquisite day, and the sun,
even so early in the morning, was "deliciously
baking," said No. 3, "decidedly
oppressive," said No. 1.
</p>

<p>
We departed in style, with our coachman
on one side of the box and our conductor
on the other, with five horses, and an energetic
little black dog perched on the roof
of the carriage, who evidently believed himself
the guardian of the whole concern, and
at the approach of every stranger ran,
frantically barking, backwards and forwards,
along his elevated platform, to the imminent
risk of his neck. Once, indeed, the small
beast overbalanced himself, and was only
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_154' name='Page_154'>[154]</a></span>
saved by alighting on the conductor's
shoulder, where he was quickly transferred
to No. 2's knee, and his acquaintance cultivated.
</p>

<p>
During the whole journey the conductor
remains the same, but the coachman
changes with each relay of horses. The
conductor was a big, fine man, with a good
head, and remarkably well-informed. As,
however, he thought it necessary to descend
and refresh himself ("with a little water,"
as he remarked innocently) at every village
we passed, his conversation became less
interesting and his company rather less
agreeable towards the middle of the day;
and we were not sorry when he found it
necessary to retire to the summit of the
diligence, and the terrier's company, for an
hour or two of snoring repose. Both he
and the coachman were armed with an
enormously long whip, some five or six
yards in length; and with these they simultaneously
slashed at the poor horses whenever
we came to any steep hill. This duty
was, however, sometimes undertaken by a
juvenile amateur of thirteen or fourteen,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_155' name='Page_155'>[155]</a></span>
whose business and pleasure it was to run
along by the side of the panting horses,
cracking the long whip furiously against
their steaming flanks, and encouraging them
with every conceivable Corsican epithet of
abuse and entreaty.
</p>

<p>
The road to Vivario, where was the mid-day
halt, was for some time a continual
ascent among beautiful views of snow-streaked
ranges on both sides.
</p>

<p>
Further on, we passed through an avenue
of chestnuts, not yet, however, in leaf, the
great boles standing by the roadside among
picturesque green and grey moss-covered
boulders of limestone, from between which
darted sparkling little streams and many
waterfalls.
</p>

<p>
When we again passed over this ground
in June, the place was a soft fairyland of
beauty, the bright green chestnuts bending
lovingly over the great stones, and throwing
dappled light and shade over the uneven
turf.
</p>

<p>
Monte Rotondo had accompanied us part
of the way from Corte, but, at the large
village of Serraggio, Monte D'Oro's great
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_156' name='Page_156'>[156]</a></span>
white flanks started out in dazzling brilliancy,
and continued for the rest of the way
to take its place.
</p>

<p>
Serraggio is beautifully situated; but it is
not a tempting-looking village. The houses
are tumble-down and dirty, and the pigs
appear to walk amicably in and out of the
houses.
</p>

<p>
From Serraggio to Vivario, passing by
Ponte Vecchio, the route is perfectly lovely.
It winds through the gorge of the Vecchio,
the river foaming at the bottom, and wildest
rocky hills, varied by snow mountains, rising
up on either side. The peaks that stood
over us were of the most eccentric shapes,
pointing like grey and brown battlements
up into the unclouded sky, and flowers of
every description blossomed beside our path.
The Mediterranean heath, especially, with
its delicate little bell-shaped flowers and
strong, sweet scent, grew luxuriantly by the
roadside, generally in height from six to
ten feet.
</p>

<p>
Ponte Vecchio is exquisitely beautiful.
At a winding turn in the road the tall one-arched
bridge spans the boiling river and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_157' name='Page_157'>[157]</a></span>
boulder-strewn gorge, surrounded by every
eccentricity of rocky hill and pine-scattered
snow mountain.
</p>

<p>
It was evidently considered rather a show
place, for the driver pulled up his vehicle,
and we all descended to take a good look.
Perhaps, too, he was not averse to resting
his horses before the final climb to Vivario,
for he gave a ready assent to the proposal
of Nos. 2 and 3, that they should finish the
distance on foot.
</p>

<p>
"How far is it?" we asked.
</p>

<p>
"About two kilomètres, mademoiselle."
</p>

<p>
We had heard of the Corsican inability to
reckon distances; but, unfortunately, at the
moment forgot it. So we set off, after a
few minutes' rest above the lovely gorge, in
an easy stroll after the now distanced diligence,
nothing suspecting, and prepared to
enjoy our mile and a half walk.
</p>

<p>
The views were exquisite,&mdash;snow mountains
rising before us on every side; but the
ascent was uncommonly steep, and our pace
insensibly slackened.
</p>

<p>
Only as the sun, after half an hour's retirement,
came out in noonday force did we
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_158' name='Page_158'>[158]</a></span>
recollect that we had left our umbrellas in
the diligence.
</p>

<p>
We began to boil as we toiled up the steep
hill, with our pocket handkerchiefs under
our hats, and the mocking diligence, ever
decreasing, yet ever in sight, winding up
the endless glare of white road above and
beyond us. And still no village to be seen!
</p>

<p>
Presently we were overtaken by some
native workmen going up the road with
their tools. They increased their pace to
come up with us, and then walked beside us
conversing.
</p>

<p>
"How far is it to Vivario from here?" we
asked, thinking surely we must be near our
goal.
</p>

<p>
"About five kilomètres, mademoiselle,"
was the answer we received, to our mortification;
almost immediately followed by the
usual question, "Are you Frenchwomen?"
</p>

<p>
"Is it often as hot as this at this time of
the year?" we inquired, as we trudged on
despairingly.
</p>

<p>
"This hot? It is not hot now; this is
only spring," was the unsympathetic reply.
</p>

<p>
We walked on so fast that we distanced
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_159' name='Page_159'>[159]</a></span>
our companions, who seemed astonished at
the energy of Englishwomen, and stopped
to remark upon it to some friendly road-menders
a little further on. It was certainly
six or seven kilomètres before, with faces
like boiled lobsters, and much tried equanimity,
we reached the promised land of
Vivario, and, passing through a stable-yard
of odoriferous propensities, ascended a little
steep wooden staircase, or outside ladder,
and entered the cool sitting-room of the
village inn.
</p>

<p>
The Vivario inn is really superior. The
people are civil and obliging, the bedrooms
are beautifully clean, the little sitting-room
is nicely furnished, and there is an air of
comfort and refinement about the household
arrangements not often to be found elsewhere
in Corsica. It possesses also a really
charmingly furnished private sitting-room,
full of rugs, pictures, easy-chairs, and other
luxuries, as a rule unknown to Corsica,
where any one in search of lovely scenery
and healthy mountain air might well spend
a week or two with great pleasure.
</p>

<p>
When we arrived, lunch was ready. We
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_160' name='Page_160'>[160]</a></span>
were a snug little party of four ladies and
two gentlemen, the strangers being French;
and we improved our acquaintance with
each other rapidly as we satisfied our
hungry appetites and discussed our sweetbreads,
duck, broccia, and dessert.
</p>

<p>
It was a short acquaintance, however;
for on reaching Ajaccio our foreign friends
went to the Hôtel de France, whilst we
went to Hôtel Germania, and we saw no
more of each other.
</p>

<p>
After a good rest and refreshment, we
started anew, with fresh horses, for the
Foce Pass.
</p>

<p>
The people of Vivario had all assembled
to see us off, and two priests walked up and
down amongst their flock, pretending to
read, but in reality as much interested in
the strangers as the smallest of the crowd.
As the diligence rolled off with a "Hué,
yoop!" from the driver, we nodded good-bye
to the friendly looking assembly, and a
number of hats were immediately taken off,
the men wishing us "salut" or "bonjour."
Only the two priests declined to take any
notice of us, and retired to a low wall a few
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_161' name='Page_161'>[161]</a></span>
yards off, where, sheltered, as they fancied,
by their shady wideawakes, they peered at
us curiously out of the corners of their eyes.
</p>

<p>
It was a terrible mount up to the top
of the Foce Pass, and, long before we
reached it, the five poor horses were exhausted
with pulling, and driver and conductor
with beating. Amateur flagellants
were at a premium, as we toiled painfully
up the smooth road, steep as the side of
a house, with greenhouse shrubs bordering
it, fir-trees on the hills above, and snow
mountains overhanging them.
</p>

<p>
In two or three hour's we reached the
forest of Vizzavona, and continued to pass
right through it. The forests of Corsica
are almost the <span lang="fr_FR"><i>specialité</i></span> of the country.
</p>

<p>
Wide and trackless, whole mountains are
covered by these splendid forests, in many
of which the sound of the hatchet has never
been heard, nor the foot of man passed, but
where the birds, the snakes, and the insects
live and die unmolested. The trees which
compose them are often magnificent, and
consist of larches, pines, firs, beeches, and
chestnuts, with a mixture of other kinds.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_162' name='Page_162'>[162]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The Larriccio pine, which sometimes
attains a height of two hundred feet, almost
without branches, but with a thick leafy
tuft at the summit of the long straight
stem, is a peculiar beauty of Corsica, and, I
believe, almost unknown elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
The chief forests in the island are those
of Sorba and Vizzavona in the centre,
Aitone and Valdoniello in the north, and
Cagna and Bavella in the south. Cagna
and Valdoniello are the largest, stretching
over miles of hill and dale, and fighting
with the snow for the rocky ledges on the
mountain crests.
</p>

<p>
Vizzavona, Valdoniello, and Bavella are
almost equally beautiful, and Sorba not
much behind them; but perhaps the views
on each side of the Bocca di Bavella, or
Bavella Pass, are the finest in Corsica.
</p>

<p>
Half of the forest of Vizzavona consists
of beeches, and the other half of pines; but
there are also a good many chestnuts, which
were not yet in leaf.
</p>

<p>
Red and brown branches mixed with the
soft young green of the beeches, and the
darker hue of the pines, as we mounted
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_163' name='Page_163'>[163]</a></span>
the steep ascent under a thick avenue;
through which, on the descending side, came
glimpses of the dazzling snow of Monte
Rotondo, rising up from beneath us to a
giddy height in the cloudy sky.
</p>

<p>
Countless bags of caterpillars hung from
every tree, and from the branches above our
heads. These bags were some of them a
foot long, and had the appearance of white
muslin. It seemed as if it was Christmas
Day in the forest, and a quantity of nomad
cooks had hung out their pudding bags upon
the boughs. After a while, snow patches
began to show, and, when at last we
reached the summit, thick snow lay all
around us.
</p>

<p>
A young Corsican who sat on the box
before us was friendly and communicative,
and, a little while before reaching the pass,
pointed out to us a queer little isolated fort,
standing on a lonely hill-top just above the
forest; which, as he informed us, with a
twinkle of his eye, was built to defend the
pass "from the English invader."
</p>

<p>
Stone shanties, with log or pebble roofs,
stood here and there along the steep roadside&mdash;mere
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_164' name='Page_164'>[164]</a></span>
hovels, built for the accommodation
of the road-menders, or <i>cantonniers</i>;
and, except the little grey fort on its exposed
hill, were the only signs of human
life, past or present, in the lonely forest.
</p>

<p>
We paused for a few minutes on the top
of the pass to let the horses regain their
breath, to look to the harness for the long
steep descent, and probably also for the
conductor to refresh himself with another
dose of "water" at the miserable little inn
on the plateau.
</p>

<p>
The two leaders also were loosed from
the traces, and, with a parting flick at their
hind quarters, were sent cantering down the
road in front of us. Meanwhile, we got
down from our perch, and tasted Corsican
snow for the first time.
</p>

<p>
The col, or Bocca, was bare of trees; and
we looked down upon magnificent views.
These cols are nearly always denuded of
vegetation, even when surrounded on every
side by rich forests. Exposed to the winds
from every quarter, they rise out of their
green nest, grey and bleak, like a bald head
surrounded by a thick monastic fringe.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_165' name='Page_165'>[165]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
On one side of us lay the forest through
which we had passed; on the other lay a
chain of blue inland hills and valleys, and
the chestnut region of Bocognano. Indigo
clouds, fringed and angry, hung above, and
everything was toned down to the same
deep stormy blue, as the thunder growled
heavily beneath us.
</p>

<p>
The snow lies exceedingly thick upon the
Foce Pass in winter, and only three weeks
before our arrival some fellow-countrymen
of ours had experienced the difficulty of
crossing the island between Corte and
Ajaccio. The diligence had broken down,
and they had been compelled to walk nine
miles through heavy snow to the nearest
halting-place; and this in the month of
March. Yet it gave one almost a shudder to
leave the cold, clear bracing air of the col,
with its sunny sky and snowy hills, for the
blue-black growling inferno at our feet. But
it had to be done, and we little guessed
with what celerity.
</p>

<p>
No sooner were the passengers reseated,
and the driver and conductor each in his
place, than both the long whips began to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_166' name='Page_166'>[166]</a></span>
play furiously, the horses were put into a
gallop, and down we went, flying over the
steep winding road like the wind, the men
shouting madly, the carriage swaying from
side to side, and the rocks and trees passing
us as in a dream.
</p>

<p>
Every corner turned was a miracle of
skill on the part of the clever horses, and,
as we hung mid-air over the precipice,
balanced like Mahomet's coffin twixt earth
and heaven, we one and all mentally breathed
our last prayer, and thought of the obituary
columns of the <i>Times</i> or <i>Galignani</i>.
</p>

<p>
The pace grew more fast and furious, and
the fun more boisterous than ever when we
sighted a porcine happy family on the road
before us, and enjoyed the sport of a chase.
</p>

<p>
Certainly those pigs ran as never could
run British or civilized pigs. The family
consisted of a stout mamma, three little
ones, and a handsome large papa, one of the
"hogs of the country," with a good deal of
the wild boar about him, being of a bright
orange colour, with high, stiff, black bristles
up his back. The chase was kept up for a
mile or two, with wonderful spirit on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_167' name='Page_167'>[167]</a></span>
part of the exhausted pigs, and amid a
chorus of laughter from drivers and passengers,
until at length a little roughness in
the side of the road allowed the panting,
squeaking victims to escape down the precipitous
slope.
</p>

<p>
Chasing the two leaders seemed tame
work after this; and No. 3 ventured to put
in a word for the general safety of the
public.
</p>

<p>
"Have the goodness," she said with
dignity, touching the arm of the conductor,
and casually moving her other hand towards
the region of her pocket, "to go a little
slower. This pace is unsafe."
</p>

<p>
The conductor looked at her with a grin
of good-humoured contempt. "Oh," said
he briefly, and as if it settled the point,
<span lang="fr_FR">"les femmes ont toujours peur!"</span>
</p>

<p>
"I am not afraid," she responded (I fear
not very truthfully), "but I possess only
one neck, and I do not wish to break it!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I have only one neck too!"
</p>

<p>
"Ah! but yours is evidently of less value
to you than mine, or you would not risk it
so lightly."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_168' name='Page_168'>[168]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
A shrug, and a mutter concerning the
relative value of heads, male and female,
was heard indistinctly; but the exordium
was not without its effect, and, rather to
our astonishment, the conductor allowed
his whip to be influenced by the words of
woman. For the next few miles, we were
allowed to run down the mountain side at a
less breakneck pace, and could enjoy the
splendid grey snow-crowned rocks that rose
up from the other side of the gorge beneath
us, and the chestnut-covered walls towering
above our heads, with less fear that every
look would be our last, finally reaching the
village of Bocognano in safety about four
o'clock.
</p>

<p>
Our fears were not unjustifiable.
</p>

<p>
When, some weeks later, we returned up
this Foce Pass to Corte in our own private
carriage, I noticed one of the many black
wooden crosses by the roadside about half-way
up the pass; and, by chance, asked our
driver if he knew its story.
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes," said he; "that is where the
prefect was killed a year ago."
</p>

<p>
"How did that happen?" we asked.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_169' name='Page_169'>[169]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Coming down the pass, something broke
in the harness, and of course the diligence
went over the precipice. The coachman
(who is a friend of mine, and told me about
it) jumped off somehow and saved himself&mdash;he
drives the same diligence now&mdash;but of
course both horses and passengers were
killed. There happened however, fortunately,
to be only one passenger, the
prefect of this part, and he was pitched on
his head just here, and died on the spot."
</p>

<p>
Had <i>our</i> diligence upset, there would
have been seven mortuary crosses to bedeck
the mountain side.

<h2>
CHAPTER XIV.
<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">A BANDIT VILLAGE.</span>
</h2>

<p>
Bocognano is, par excellence, the village of
the bandits. It was formerly the home
of the brothers Bella Coschia, the latest
and most famous of the bandits of the
present generation.
</p>

<p>
It is difficult to get at the truth regarding
these two men, but there is little doubt that
they have never had much to recommend
them. Out of their own village they are
generally admitted to have been regular
ruffians; although, in Bocognano, they are
declared to be most pleasing fellows.
</p>

<p>
There is a little shyness, however, in
speaking of their errors, especially in this
neighbourhood, which perhaps is not much
to be wondered at, considering that sixty
members of their family inhabit the village.
The younger of the two brothers is only
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_171' name='Page_171'>[171]</a></span>
forty-two, and the elder one not more than
fifty; but for some years these wild animals
have shown signs of taming, and now lead
a tolerably harmless and inoffensive life on
the mountain side, where, by tacit consent,
so long as they thus keep out of the way,
they remain unmolested by the gendarmes.
</p>

<p>
A dark ravine on the blue flank of Monte
D'Oro, a few miles above and beyond
Bocognano, was pointed out to us as the
almost inaccessible home of the two bandits.
</p>

<p>
Their native village receives from them
the milk of their mountain goats, and supplies
them with the necessaries of life.
</p>

<p>
By day, the men remain in their rocky
stronghold; but at night they constantly
descend the ravine and visit their friends
and relations at Bocognano.
</p>

<p>
Night and day are the same to these
wild, lawless climbers, who leap down the
precipitous crags which separate their
cavern dwelling from the village, with
fearless security, in the darkest night.
</p>

<p>
A gentleman we afterwards met, who had
been introduced, by special favour, to their
stronghold, and appeared to have relished
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_172' name='Page_172'>[172]</a></span>
his call much, described them as well-educated
men. They could both, he said,
speak and read either French or Italian;
and he had seen a letter written by one of
them in the most idiomatic French. The
younger brother, he asserted, became a
bandit because of the conscription; preferring
a roving and lawless life, and
amateur skirmishes on his own account
with the gendarmerie, to a forced service
in the French army.
</p>

<p>
The Bella Coschias, however, were not
of any particular rank amongst their fellow-villagers,
although their name, like that of
so many Corsicans, is one well known and
a good one in Italy.
</p>

<p>
A driver whom we employed later on,
and who was much more trustworthy than
our French friend, afterwards told us more
of the bandit brothers. On one occasion,
one of them had made his way for some
reason to Ajaccio, and our coachman drove
him back by night in a close carriage to
Bocognano&mdash;some twenty miles.
</p>

<p>
This was several years ago, when the
man was undoubtedly a <span lang="fr_FR"><i>mauvais sujet</i></span>, murdering
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_173' name='Page_173'>[173]</a></span>
and evil-doing in every direction,
simply for the gratification of his own bad
passions; and yet neither our driver, a remarkably
superior, unprejudiced man, nor
his master, a well-to-do coach owner,
dreamt of doing otherwise than protecting
the bandit from the French government.
</p>

<p>
It will be some time yet before law is
recognized in Corsica, or the natives learn
to give up, into its hands, their right of
judgment regarding private feuds and local
offenders.
</p>

<p>
After all, the excuse for this condition of
things lies in the mal-administration of
justice under which poor Corsica groaned
for centuries, and which forced public
opinion to take the law into its own hands,
and regard the procedure of the courts as
only a source of foreign oppression and
complicated misfortune. The same cause
probably has to answer for the vendetta,
for so many years the curse of Corsica, and
the disgrace of a noble people.
</p>

<p>
The vendetta has been the internal disease
of the island, breaking out again and
again, and often sapping the strength and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_174' name='Page_174'>[174]</a></span>
destroying the harmony of the different
members of the community.
</p>

<p>
It was the natural result of a hopelessly
corrupt legislature among a warlike people
of strong passions and revengeful propensities;
and as such, must not be judged too
hardly.
</p>

<p>
It is an incontrovertible fact that
the law of the vendetta was, in its first
action, not only allowed, but enforced,
among the early Jews by the Mosaic
dispensation.
</p>

<p>
The Corsicans (if we put aside the
humanizing effect of Christianity) have
had greater reason and excuse for their
practice of private retribution than ever
had the Jews; for the Jews had a court
of unassailable purity presided over by the
delegate of the Deity Himself, whilst the
poor Corsican could hope for no verdict
unbought by gold, or uninfluenced by party
spirit, and could bring down no judgment
on the head of assassin or robber, save that
meted out by the wrathful strength of his
own right hand. But a custom which began
not unreasonably, and with so much excuse,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_175' name='Page_175'>[175]</a></span>
spread until it became a monstrous horror
in the land.
</p>

<p>
Men were not content with the pursuit
and death of the murderer or the robber
only&mdash;his whole family became their lawful
prey; and, in return, every member of that
family sought to shed the blood of their
pursuers.
</p>

<p>
Children, before they were born, were
doomed to the same unrelenting life of
savage hate and bloodshed; and boys of
tender years were brought by the mothers
that bare them, before the bloody corpse
of their father, and made to swear, with
baby lips, undying vengeance and murderous
retribution, so soon as their hands should
be strong enough to grasp a gun, and their
skill sufficient to point it home to the heart
of the foe.
</p>

<p>
Thus the hand of every man was against
his neighbour; and this not for serious
causes only. Soon, the vendetta between
different families began to arise from the
most trivial causes. A man spoke slightingly
of another man's friend or relative, or,
maybe, his dog&mdash;a dispute occurred as to a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_176' name='Page_176'>[176]</a></span>
date, a measurement, the opinions of a
third. A hot word was spoken: out came
the ready dagger, or the ever-loaded gun or
pistol,&mdash;a human heart ceased beating, and a
murderer fled to the maquis on the mountain
side, or the caverns on the lonely rocks, and
became thenceforth a pariah, issuing only
to commit fresh murders, supported secretly
by his relations, but never more known to
the world at large; until at length a retributive
bullet laid him low, or his hiding
place was betrayed, and he miserably slain
by the military police of his country.
</p>

<p>
This hydra-headed monster had grown
to such an extent, that between the years
1770 and 1800, when the vendetta was at
its height, some 7000 murders occurred, all
on its account; and only the strenuous
measures of the French government succeeded
in checking the evil.
</p>

<p>
It was made penal for a man to carry
a gun or any other weapon, except under
certain restrictions, and in certain cases.
This law continued in force for a few years,
and worked so well that the number of
violent deaths decreased almost to <i>nil</i>. But
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_177' name='Page_177'>[177]</a></span>
the law has been rescinded the last few
years, and now again you see every man
with his loaded gun. And the number of
murders, although nothing like what it
was in former times, yet has increased again
greatly.
</p>

<p>
This inland region is specially the region
of arms. You rarely meet a peasant without
a gun strapped behind his shoulder, and
a pistol or two in his vest; and our driver
informed me that they are always carried
loaded.
</p>

<p>
"With what?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"With bullets, of course."
</p>

<p>
"To kill game?" asked I (knowing,
however, that this was not the place for
large game).
</p>

<p>
"Pour se defendre," said he, with a queer
look.
</p>

<p>
"That means&mdash;to shoot one another as
soon as a quarrel occurs?"
</p>

<p>
He shrugged his shoulders silently, and
smiled assent.
</p>

<p>
In the vendetta one touch of barbarity is
spared&mdash;the women and children are unassailed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_178' name='Page_178'>[178]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
But instances where women have taken
the law into their own hands, and shot a
faithless lover, or even a family foe, are not
unusual; and of course, they are constantly
the provoking cause of many a masculine
vendetta.
</p>

<p>
As a rule, these female murderers are
leniently judged. One young woman, well
known to our driver, had, a short time
before, openly shot her lover through the
heart with a pistol, but had only been condemned
to six months' imprisonment; while
another, for a similar offence, but probably
rather less of provocation, had received
sentence of a year's incarceration. Capital
punishment is abolished in Corsica, and
imprisonment for life substituted. It is
doubtful whether this latter penalty, to the
free islander, is not a more dreaded calamity
than even the loss of life.
</p>

<p>
But the fierce and revengeful nature which
has fostered the vendetta is combined with
many noble qualities. The Corsican is, and
always has been, honest, hospitable, and
truthful; and he would scorn to take advantage
of a lonely stranger. There is something
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_179' name='Page_179'>[179]</a></span>
essentially manly about these people;
and the base and petty vices of more
so-called refined countries are unknown to
them. There is an immense difference
between them and the people of the neighbouring
island of Sardinia, or that of Sicily.
</p>

<p>
The Corsicans have a thorough and well-merited
contempt for the natives of Sardinia.
"They are nothing, those Sardes, but a race
of robbers, assassins, and liars," said a man
to me with emphasis at Bonifacio.
</p>

<p>
Bonifacio is the nearest Corsican town to
Sardinia, and looks across some narrow
straits towards the Italian island with no
friendly feelings.
</p>

<p>
From what we heard of Sardinia, travelling
is neither safe nor agreeable there. It
is not a particularly interesting country save
for its antiquarian remains, being far flatter
and less full of natural beauties than Corsica;
and, although it boasts a railway, it is as
far behind its neighbour in civilization and
in the character of its inhabitants, as in the
facilities it affords to travellers.
</p>

<p>
The inns are, I believe, worse, and dirtier
than in Corsica; the roads are not so good,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_180' name='Page_180'>[180]</a></span>
and brigands abound; whilst there is little
in the character of Sardinian scenery to
compensate for the domestic discomfort.
</p>

<p>
The people are reported sly, and as
possessing little of the honesty and courtesy
common in Corsica; on the contrary, they
regard travellers as their lawful prey. The
railway trains are occasionally fired at and
pillaged by brigands, and highway robbers
still infest the country.
</p>

<p>
This was never the case in Corsica. For
centuries the people have prided themselves
upon their honesty, and a murder for greed
of gold is unknown. The traveller's purse
and his person are safe, amongst the wildest
and roughest of the inhabitants. Quarrelling
over money interests is unusual; and a
vendetta is said to have been rarely, if ever,
caused by a dispute over such matters.
</p>

<p>
The killing and slaying amongst the
people has been barbarous enough, Heaven
knows; but it has rarely owed its origin
to any lower motive than a mistaken or
exaggerated idea of honour, or, at the
worst, a love of lawless freedom and adventure.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_181' name='Page_181'>[181]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The difference between the Corsican
bandit and the Sardinian or Sicilian brigand
is the difference of races far apart from each
other as the poles. Notwithstanding their
contiguity, the two islands have rarely had
anything to do with each other for many
centuries, and the wild white breakers that
roll, nine months of the year, between the
"Bouches de Bonifacio," separate two
nationalities that have never known sympathy.
</p>

<p>
A Corsican bandit can occasionally be a
much nearer neighbour than one suspects.
</p>

<p>
A gentleman at Bocognano told us that
a bandit, about a year ago, had spent six
months in a cave at the bottom of a garden
close to Ajaccio. During this time, he was
regularly supplied at night with food by one
or two friends, at which time also he emerged
from his hiding-place and walked abroad
with caution; and, at the end of the six
months, took his departure and escaped to
the mountains near. The garden was close
to the house, and the bandit, in his gloomy
hole, must have listened almost daily to the
voices of the children playing about, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_182' name='Page_182'>[182]</a></span>
watched the householder and his wife as
they strolled up and down.
</p>

<p>
It was only after the bird had flown that
the owner was made aware of the strange
visitor he had unconsciously harboured for
so long in the vicinity of his home.
</p>

<p>
"Did it not give him a shudder to think
of the man lying there close by, night and
day?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Oh no," was the reply; "why should he
fear? The bandit had no quarrel with <i>him</i>."
</p>

<p>
Walking through the lonely mountains,
and in and out of the wild country rocks,
one feels that one is in the natural country
of the fierce outlaw; but in sunny, modern,
cheery little Ajaccio, it is almost as difficult
to realize the existence or the close proximity
of the bandit as it would be in a Belgravian
drawing-room.
</p>

<p>
For some time after leaving the dirty
uninteresting-looking little village of Bocognano,
the road continues very fine, descending
constantly among magnificent mountain
forms, heaped together in every direction,
and passing under the grateful shade of
young-leaved oaks and budding chestnuts.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_183' name='Page_183'>[183]</a></span>
Miniature Geissbach falls dropped beside
us, and long-haired goats, black, and brown,
and parti-coloured, with graceful heads and
large shy eyes, bounded past in terror.
</p>

<p>
At a village boasting the queer name of
Fiasco, we took up our last relay of horses,
and our fifth coachman. He was a young
fellow with a gentle, smiling face and
courteous manner. His horses were, contrary
to most of the diligence horses, in
excellent condition. They had not a rough
or a sore place upon them apparently, which
was more than could be said for any of the
others; and their driver neither required
nor used his long whip, nor did he indulge
in the various and inharmonious yells of the
other four coachmen.
</p>

<p>
This young man was afterwards introduced
to us by a fellow-driver as a nephew
and great admirer of the two Bella Coschia
bandits.
</p>

<p>
"He looks kind," said I.
</p>

<p>
"He is a 'brave homme,'" was the warm
reply; "and would not injure a fly"&mdash;which,
I have no doubt, was true.
</p>

<p>
The barbarous condition in which horses,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_184' name='Page_184'>[184]</a></span>
and especially mules, are driven in Corsica,
is much to be deplored. It is a rare exception
to meet with a mule without one or
more sores upon its back or legs; and we
sometimes saw them at work with an open
wound the size of a saucer upon them.
The flies in summer must be a terrible
aggravation to the sufferings of these poor
beasts.
</p>

<p>
As a rule, however, it is only the draught
mules which are thus wounded; and the
riding mules are generally whole and well-looking.
</p>

<p>
There is great excuse for the condition of
the animals in the steep roads and the
wretched pay received by their owners, the
charettiers.
</p>

<p>
Forced to bring heavy loads of wood
down mere mountain paths, dangerously
steep and twisting, working often night and
day for very insufficient pay, and often at
risk of life and limb to themselves, these
poor charettiers are constrained to overwork
their mules, as they are themselves
overworked, and have neither the power
nor the inclination to spare them ill-usage.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_185' name='Page_185'>[185]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Yet, I do not think the Corsican is often
a voluntarily cruel driver. I never, or
rarely, saw one of these wood-carters beating
or personally ill-treating his mules.
But all over the island there is a tacit
indifference to animal suffering.
</p>

<p>
I wish the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals would establish a branch
for the service of mules and horses in
Corsica. But they would probably find
it hot work at first, as these are not a
people who approve of interference in any
quarter.
</p>

<p>
One lady, well known in Ajaccio, who
took up a short time ago the cause of the
poor mules, and made an effort to bring
to justice one or two owners of ill-used
animals, was rewarded by a small hornet's
nest about her ears; and, I was told,
had a note sent her anonymously <span lang="fr_FR">"à
l'Irlandais,"</span> in which she was informed that
it was well for her she was of the weaker
sex, or she might have suffered for her
temerity!
</p>

<p>
As we approached the neighbourhood of
Ajaccio, the mountains lowered their heads
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_186' name='Page_186'>[186]</a></span>
and soon gave place to wooded hills; and,
beyond this, to fine rocks. Then, as the
sun sank slowly towards the horizon, the
fading sunlight fell upon a foaming river
following the road, on one side, and lit up
the upper part of the rich shrub-covered
cliff which overhung it on the other.
</p>

<p>
We were now almost on level land, and
a broad plain lay before us, about six miles
long, marshy and malarious, at the end of
which was the wide-stretching Mediterranean,
blue and still, with a white tongue
of land reaching out, and dotted with little
houses sparkling in the last rays of evening
sunshine.
</p>

<p>
This bright little town, lying on its white
arm far out into the lovely sea, was Ajaccio.
Round it curved many a bay; and beyond
it gleamed many a distant island, as we
sped over the plain at an easy gallop, under
young Bella Coschia's gentle rein.
</p>

<p>
Then came an English-looking lane or
two, with grassy banks and overhanging
trees; and then, a sudden turn on to what
may be called the Esplanade of Ajaccio&mdash;a
broad flat road, shaded by a grateful
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_187' name='Page_187'>[187]</a></span>
avenue of chestnuts and sycamores, winding
along the shore of the bay, past the quay
and the statue of Napoleon, and up the
hilly street of the gay little town.
</p>

<p>
No place could have looked fairer than
did Ajaccio on our first view of it. Sea and
sky were glowing crimson with sunset hues,
the hills and promontories on the other side
of the bay were a rich purple, while the
houses shone bright and clean against the
vivid background, their windows painted
gold, and the streets shaded by fresh-leaved
young trees.
</p>

<p>
The little town was all astir in the freshness
and cool of a lovely spring evening;
for it was just the time when, in Corsica,
men, women, and children are all abroad in
the streets.
</p>

<p>
Gay stalls of oranges and vegetables
lined the ascent; bright red and blue
uniforms mixed with blue blouses and
brown velveteens; mule carts, with their
jingling bells and scarlet trappings, ran up
and down merrily; and men in their shirt
sleeves (and every Corsican seems to wear
a white shirt) sat before their open doors,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_188' name='Page_188'>[188]</a></span>
smoking their pipes, with children and dogs
playing round them, and their wives, in
white or coloured head-gear, standing near
in gossip under the trees.
</p>

<p>
A few young ladies, got up in tight
dresses and frizzed hair, likewise walked,
in couples, or arm in arm with a dark-complexioned
father, solemnly up and
down; while whiskered Frenchmen sat in
front of the little cafés under their awnings,
and sailors of several nations rolled merrily
along the streets, whistling or singing.
</p>

<p>
Then on through the main street of the
town, out again upon the blue sea, the
Place de Napoleon with its fine statues of
the first Napoleon and his four brothers,
past the Hôtel de France close by, and up
the Cours de Grandval a little way, planted
with its avenue of young chestnuts,&mdash;on to
Hôtel Germania, lying against a wooded
hill, the last house in the street, with front
door open to welcome the traveller, and
green shutters just being turned back from
the shaded windows.
</p>

<p>
Oh, the delights of once more entering
an establishment where the polished floors
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_189' name='Page_189'>[189]</a></span>
shone with cleanliness, where the paper did
not hang in foul strips from the walls,
where indescribable odours did not greet
one from every open window and up every
staircase, and where the reptile and the
insect knew no abiding-place! Oh, the
revelling in tubs and cold water, the luxury
of a bell with some one to answer it, and
the charms of bread not sour, and butter
that could be eaten!
</p>

<p>
Howsoever beautiful be nature, the most
æsthetic mind is too much a slave to the
vile body to know perfect mental enjoyment
when living in constant dread of physical
discomfort and disgust. Any one who has
ever travelled out of the beaten track will
understand the joy with which we took
possession of our dainty little rooms at
Ajaccio, after our week's roughing, and
will excuse this rhapsody.

</p>

<h2>
CHAPTER XV.
<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">THE TOWN OF AJACCIO.</span>
</h2>

<p>
English people are apt, at Ajaccio, to incur
a good deal of public obloquy and well-merited
contempt by their pronunciation
of the name. In their Northern ignorance,
they are accustomed to pronounce the two
<i>c</i>'s soft; and find considerable difficulty
in schooling their tongues to the popular
sneeze-like intonation.
</p>

<p>
In this dilemma, I bethought me of a
plan adopted by a fond and phonetic mother
I had known years ago, to cure a failing
common amongst those of tender years,
viz., the adding of an agreeable but unnecessary
<i>r</i> to those Christian names which
terminate in a vowel, and by whom the
following couplet was composed, to be repeated
twenty times daily by her children&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">
"Give Anna-an apple, and Julia-a cake;
</p>
<p>
Send Maria-Eliza-afloat on the lake."
</p>
</div></div></div>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_191' name='Page_191'>[191]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Acting on this precedent, I put my poetic
muse to work, and, in an incredibly short
space of time, had composed this chaste and
elegant refrain&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">
"Ajaccio! Ajaccio!
</p>
<p>
What name so very catchy, O!
</p>
<p>
Is there a town can match thee, O,
</p>
<p>
To turn adrift a scratch trio
</p>
<p>
Of English dames, Ajaccio?"
</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
This verse I took, as a sort of mental pill,
last thing before getting into bed, repeating
the dose whenever I happened to wake in
the night. At breakfast time, and whilst
employed at my toilet, I continued the
same process, mixing Ajaccio up with
coffee and rolls; and, before noon, had the
comfort of feeling that the disease was
cured, and the national sneeze effectually
imitated.
</p>

<p>
This trifling incident is only named for
the benefit of any future English travellers
afflicted with a like difficulty.
</p>

<p>
Ajaccio is one of the most delightful little
towns possible for a residence. Both climate
and population wear a sunny air that can
hardly fail, one would think, to put even the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_192' name='Page_192'>[192]</a></span>
proverbial British grumbler into good spirits
and a good temper.
</p>

<p>
The views on every side are smiling and
lovely, without being oppressively grand.
For everyday use such a landscape wears
best, as, in domestic life, a cheerful comely
woman is preferable to a magnificently
attired belle.
</p>

<p>
Soft purple hills, a blue, gently heaving
sea, and pretty white villas, nestling amongst
groves of trees, are the sights of Ajaccio,
all melting and glowing in the glory of the
mid-day sun, or gathering, every half-hour,
new lights and shadows, till the haze of
evening.
</p>

<p>
The town itself is far cleaner than any
other in Corsica; the streets are gay and
busy, with a French liveliness; the inhabitants
have a remarkable talent for smiling,
and the tradespeople are the most civil in
the world. Their politeness absolutely
knows no bounds. They place the most
unbounded confidence in strangers; and
you may enter a shop without your purse
and carry off an armful of purchases, to the
entire satisfaction of the owner, who quite
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_193' name='Page_193'>[193]</a></span>
blushes on being told of your name and
residence.
</p>

<p>
It is apparently considered quite a favour
to be allowed to show you the way, and the
straw hats are pulled off with a polished
smile worthy of Beau Brummel. One man,
at a chemist's door, went so far as to thank
us for having thus appealed to him!
</p>

<p>
Another, an optician, a sweet-looking
old gentleman, in a grey slop and wide-awake,
after having vainly searched for some
time for an eye-glass to suit No. 3, was
quite overcome when she apologized for the
useless trouble given; and showed off the
talents of his handsome black and white
retriever, which, at his request, leaped upon
a chair to kiss his master, with a paw placed
on either shoulder.
</p>

<p>
The shops at Ajaccio are fairly good, and
more modern in appearance than at Bastia;
and certainly they deserve to be patronized,
if it is only to learn good manners.
</p>

<p>
The climate of Ajaccio is lovely; very
little rain falls there.
</p>

<p>
During our different visits to the town
this highly rainy and unsatisfactory spring,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_194' name='Page_194'>[194]</a></span>
only one day, I think, was really wet; and
I noticed that the weather generally seemed
brighter here than elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
In winter it is charming. November,
December, January, February, and March,
vary exceedingly little in temperature, ranging
from fifty-five to sixty-five degrees
Fahrenheit, with an average of sixty-two
degrees; but Miss Campbell declares January
and February to be the most perfect months
of the year in Ajaccio; and March is certainly
far less windy, chilly, and dusty here
than on the Riviera.
</p>

<p>
In April the temperature generally rises
considerably, and towards the end of the
month the winter visitors begin to leave in
a body. It becomes then rather too relaxing,
but is wonderfully free from mosquitoes
and fevers, and other Southern plagues, up
to the month of July; when, although not
positively dangerous, like the towns on the
eastern coast, it is decidedly not healthy
for any Northern stranger who may be
enough of a salamander to brave its tropical
heat.
</p>

<p>
In July and August, even the natives,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_195' name='Page_195'>[195]</a></span>
under their big umbrellas, dread the glaring
sun; the upper classes all remove to their
country houses or summer lodgings up
among the hills, and the snakes and lizards
hold high jinks on deserted road and furnace-like
rock; whilst the scorpions, whose sting
is death to man or beast, occasionally vary
their amusements by appearing <i>within</i> the
houses.
</p>

<p>
Ajaccio is more and more becoming a
winter resort for consumptive persons. The
temperature is as mild as that of Mentone,
and more equable. It is less expensive,
equally comfortable, and equally beautiful
in its surroundings.
</p>

<p>
The one drawback, of course, is the
voyage; but good vessels run two or three
times a week from Marseilles to Ajaccio
direct, a voyage of sixteen hours; and this
is decidedly the best and easiest route for
invalids (unless exceptionally bad sailors), as
they then avoid the smaller vessels, and the
long cold land journey over the interior from
Bastia.
</p>

<p>
The Hôtel Germania in Ajaccio is excellent,
and leaves nothing to be desired.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_196' name='Page_196'>[196]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
There are, as I have said, two hotels in
the town; both large and good.
</p>

<p>
The Hôtel de France is decidedly cheaper,
and, we were told, was comfortable, and well-managed
by an exceedingly attentive landlord;
but I fancy a few luxuries to be had
at Hôtel Germania are not attainable
there.
</p>

<p>
But the great attraction for invalids in
Hôtel Germania is that it is the usual
nucleus of the resident English.
</p>

<p>
The chaplain (here for the winter season)
usually stays at this hotel; the house is
warm, and airy, and spacious; the bedrooms
are dainty and well furnished, and there is
a cosy salle de lecture, or drawing-room,
containing a good piano.
</p>

<p>
Tidy little maids, in muslin caps and
aprons, attend upon the ladies' wants; the
mistress is kind and attentive, and the food
is said to be rather superior to that at the
other hotel.
</p>

<p>
From ten to twelve francs a day is the
usual price at the Hôtel Germania for
"pension" in the season. This includes
a nice room with sofa and writing-table;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_197' name='Page_197'>[197]</a></span>
attendance, and three meals, including six
o'clock table d'hôte.
</p>

<p>
The hotel is out of the town, but within
two minutes' walk of it; built against a
green wooded hill, covered with prickly
pear, and thickly populated by nightingales;
and has a nice little garden of its own, rich
in roses and scarlet geraniums.
</p>

<p>
Every winter a little English band of
visitors, from twenty to forty in number,
gathers here; and the society within the
house is generally exceedingly pleasant and
sociable.
</p>

<p>
Outside, there are lovely walks and drives;
carriages can be hired at two francs the
hour; and the pretty English church (in
which, during the winter, service is held
two or three times a week by the chaplain)
is within a stone's throw.
</p>

<p>
For a botanist, there are ferns and flowers
innumerable along the roads; and for a
conchologist, there are plenty of pretty
shells on the long range of sands.
</p>

<p>
The town itself has remarkably few smells
for Corsica, and strangers can walk about
without being followed and mobbed by
juvenile savages.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_198' name='Page_198'>[198]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The Place du Marché, out of the principal
street, and looking upon the open quay, is a
pretty square. In the centre of it, gazing
out upon the blue sea and the bluer hills,
rises a large marble statue of the first
Napoleon, surrounded by little fan palms
and other shrubs, and by light fountain jets.
The statue is not worth much, but its
position and surroundings are well chosen;
and the Ajaccio fountains, unlike those of
Trafalgar Square, play constantly, not occasionally.
</p>

<p>
Place Buonaparte, a little further on, in
the Cours Grandval, is very fine. It is just
beyond the street and the town, and is a
wide open space facing the sea, and in front
of the tree-lined Boulevard.
</p>

<p>
A large and imposing group stands in its
midst. Napoleon on horseback is the central
figure; on each side of him stand two of
his brothers, guarding, as it were, the four
corners of the dais on which he is stationed.
The figures are in bronze, and well-executed;
and the group is most striking, seen
from the Boulevard, standing out vividly, as
it does, against the perfect blue of sea and
sky.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_199' name='Page_199'>[199]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Behind the group are some remarkably
hideous but useful drinking fountains; an
oasis for the thirsty traveller in the midst
of the white, dusty, unshadowed Place.
</p>

<p>
The cathedral (for Ajaccio is an ancient
bishopric) is but a poor building. It is
small, ornamented with a few pillars of grey
Corsican marble, with local black marble
round the principal altar, and another of a
peculiar but not pretty tint, dappled yellow,
decorating some of the side altars.
</p>

<p>
Two of these, both dedicated to the
Virgin, were illuminated in a singular way.
A slit was made in the roof, through which
the light of a lamp streamed down upon the
picture, shining upon the head of the
Madonna, and gilding the sky behind her.
</p>

<p>
The images of the saints were peculiarly
grotesque and out of taste in their adornments,
and one wondered how any one,
with the smallest sense of the ludicrous,
could have allowed such absurdities to mar
a religious spot.
</p>

<p>
A brightly coloured Madonna, with a very
yellow face, placed upon a small pedestal,
wore a huge wreath of white artificial
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_200' name='Page_200'>[200]</a></span>
flowers surmounting and almost concealing
her most uninviting countenance, whilst
another hung on her outstretched wrist, and
innumerable glass beads and gaudy brass
rings decked throat, and dress, and well-displayed
fingers.
</p>

<p>
But, further on, was a far more ridiculous
figure on another pedestal. It was, I fancy,
St. Nicodemus&mdash;an exceedingly black-browed
personage, got up in a species of ball-costume,
with a large white wreath decorating
his thick black hair, and another,
equally big, hung round his neck and falling
below a heavy beard, whilst a long red-beaded
rosary fell from his extended arm.
</p>

<p>
If the clergy of Ajaccio, however, have
no sense of humour, they apparently understand
the meaning of hard work; for I was
struck by a written notice, affixed to one
of the confessionals, which stated that a
certain Abbé Simconi, one of the cathedral
staff, attends daily here from 6 to 11 a.m.,
and from 1 to 6 p.m., for the purpose of
hearing the confessions of his flock. After
this, no one can say that the Corsican
clerics are idle.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_201' name='Page_201'>[201]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
CHAPTER XVI.
<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">NAPOLEON'S HOUSE.</span>
</h2>

<p>
One of the first sights to be visited in
Ajaccio is the house belonging to the
Buonaparte family, and in which Napoleon
was born. Every Corsican is, of course,
proud to the backbone of the great national
hero; and as Corte seems to breathe the
presence of the wise, heroic, unselfish Paoli,
so Ajaccio is full of the footmarks of the
world-famed conqueror, the second son of
Carlo Buonaparte, the Corsican solicitor.
</p>

<p>
The emperor, during his lifetime, did not
perhaps do much for his country. He
loved it, but the benefits he intended to
confer upon it were, like many of our good
deeds, from the time of Felix downwards,
put off to a more convenient season; and
those he effected consisted chiefly in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_202' name='Page_202'>[202]</a></span>
making of a few good roads in the island,
and the raising to posts of honour of many
of his more talented compatriots. His
adoption of French nationality, and elevation
to the imperial throne, smoothed the
path of submission to his proud and independent
countrymen, who delight to say
now, with an excusable and harmless
conceit, of their paternal government, "<i>We</i>
have annexed France."
</p>

<p>
At one time it was proposed to rechristen
Ajaccio after the name of the great emperor;
but this was wisely given up, and the old
title (supposed to be from an ancient hero
called Ajazzo) was retained.
</p>

<p>
Turning out of a main street to the right
of the sparkling Place du Marché, runs a
narrow entry, opening upon a tiny square,
formed by a garden and cottage on one side,
and by a high, comfortable-looking, but
unpretentious house on the other.
</p>

<p>
Place Letitzia (so called from Napoleon's
mother) is the name of this little square,
and the high, modern house was the home
of Napoleon.
</p>

<p>
Going through a gate into a little garden,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_203' name='Page_203'>[203]</a></span>
we knocked at the cottage door smothered
in roses and creepers, and an aged crone,
of dainty appearance and pleasant countenance,
came out, key in hand. This old
lady is the <i>concierge</i> of the house, and an
old servant of the Buonaparte family. As
she was toothless, and spoke a most extraordinary
jumble of French and Italian,
consisting chiefly of French words with an
Italian termination, it was difficult to
understand much that she said; but there
was no mistaking her devotion to the
family.
</p>

<p>
She remembered Madame Mère well,
whose death occurred so many years after
that of her exiled son; and she spoke
with enthusiasm of her present mistress, a
princess of the Buonaparte family, and
daughter of Prince Lucien, who lives in
the upper storey of the house. "Ah!"
she said, laughing and clasping her hands,
"she is so sweet and so kind, my dear
princess, and so pretty! If you could but
see her! But she is now gone to Mass,
unfortunately. She does not seem more
than sixteen, she is so bright and young,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_204' name='Page_204'>[204]</a></span>
although she is nearly sixty. Look at her
portrait here."
</p>

<p>
We did not see the princess, whose tame
parrot kept calling from the upper regions.
But we heard that her old servant's admiration
of her amiability was not unmerited.
This lady gave some pleasant <i>réunions</i> at
her house last winter, at which some of the
English, resident in Ajaccio, attended.
</p>

<p>
In some of the rooms were drawings by
the late Prince Imperial, who, with his
mother, some years ago, visited the home
of the founder of their dynasty. The
empress, then in the heyday of prosperity
and glory, and little foreseeing the widowed
exile so soon to come upon her, was yet
deeply moved as she went through the
deserted rooms, and shed tears of emotion.
</p>

<p>
Passing through the unpretentious doorway,
we went up a stone staircase, three
or four feet wide, until we reached the first
storey. It consisted of a succession of six
or seven rooms, all opening one into the
other, and coming out finally at the other
side of the little landing. The rooms were
square and comfortable-looking, of a good
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_205' name='Page_205'>[205]</a></span>
size, most of them with chairs or armoires,
or some articles of furniture left in them.
Some of the tables and chests were very
pretty, of marble, or inlaid with coloured
woods.
</p>

<p>
On the first storey was the "reception-room"&mdash;a
long, low apartment, from which
the chandeliers had been removed, but
still hung round with numerous small
mirrors, and prettily painted. In this
room M. Buonaparte (who was a man of
position, his family being considered the
second in Ajaccio, and he himself being
rather a noted local orator and politician)
received a good deal of society, assisted by
his beautiful and graceful wife, Letitia
Ramolini.
</p>

<p>
The portraits of Madame Mère, taken in
her youth, some of which were hanging on
the walls of her house, show us the
<i>spirituelle</i> beauty, with her dark, brilliant
eyes, her sweet smile, and her bewitching
features.
</p>

<p>
Few women have had a more romantic
life. Married at the age of seventeen, to
a husband who fell passionately in love
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_206' name='Page_206'>[206]</a></span>
with her before she was much more than
a child, and whose rank was scarcely equal
to her own, her devotion to him and to her
children was only equalled by her remarkable
spirit and her natural ambition.
</p>

<p>
It is easy to see whence the first Napoleon
gained his early childish aspirations after
greatness.
</p>

<p>
The wife of a simple <i>avocat</i> in a small
Mediterranean island, she lived to see four
out of her five sons crowned as kings, and
two of her daughters become princesses.
But she lived, too, to see those kings dethroned
and disgraced, to see the greatest
of them dying slowly with a broken heart;
and herself to close her eyes on a foreign
shore, exiled and sad of heart, driven out
from her own country, and repudiated by
the very town in which her son was born.
If ever any woman had cause to learn the
sad meaning of the oft-repeated adage, "Sic
transit gloria mundi," it was Madame Mère
in her prolonged old age at Rome, where,
though still surrounded by loving and
admiring friends, the beautiful old lady
must often have looked back with a sore
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_207' name='Page_207'>[207]</a></span>
heart to the cosy house at Ajaccio, in
which, years ago, she and Carlo Buonaparte
ruled over their numerous family of sons
and daughters, little dreaming of slippery
sceptres, or of the unsubstantial greatness
of conquest.
</p>

<p>
The reception-room windows opened out
upon a paved and enclosed terrace, surrounded
by flowers. Here Napoleon and
his four brothers used often to play, peeping
through the balustrade upon the sunny
street below; and here the old concierge
picked us each a spray or two of scented
geranium that was <i>said</i> to have been
growing there ever since his time.
</p>

<p>
A little bedroom on this storey is shown
as the one in which the great man was
born, and here is still the small iron bedstead
always used by madame.
</p>

<p>
This storey was kept for the use of
Monsieur and Madame Buonaparte and
their friends, and for the reception-rooms.
The second storey, up another stone flight,
was devoted to the children. Here we saw
Napoleon's bedroom, with a broken chair
or two, and a curious old inlaid brown
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_208' name='Page_208'>[208]</a></span>
wood chest, in which he kept his playthings
and clothes. Leading out of it was the
children's play-room, where the boy, always
military in his tastes, made tiny cannon,
and fought on the table mimic battles,
which, out of the house, developed into
assaults and sieges with his brothers or
schoolfellows, of whom he was always the
leader. Even as a child, Napoleon was the
ruling spirit among his brothers; he was
a second Joseph, to whose superior energy
and genius the rest of his family intuitively
bowed down.
</p>

<p>
All these rooms were airy, large, and
pleasant-looking; and I felt that I had not
sufficiently realized before, the comfortable
position and ample means belonging to the
Buonaparte family.
</p>

<p>
We came down the stone staircase, and
out of the cool, shady rooms, with a strange
new feeling of the <i>reality</i> of Moscow, of
Waterloo, and of St. Helena; and, going
across the sunny glare of the little garden
opposite, acceded to the kind invitation of our
old woman to visit the snug sitting-room.
</p>

<p>
This cottage and garden, in which she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_209' name='Page_209'>[209]</a></span>
and her husband live, belongs to the Buonapartes,
but is a gift to her for life.
</p>

<p>
Her little sitting-room, cosily furnished
and full of flowers, is a perfect commentary
on European history for the last century.
Scarcely an inch of the four walls is left
uncovered by photograph, engraving, or
sketch: nearly all of historical interest.
</p>

<p>
Madame Mère and the first Napoleon
commence the series of portraits&mdash;taken
from life, nearly a hundred years ago, in
their native land; many of the emperor's
brothers and sisters are represented also;
the present Princess Marianna, with other
relatives; sketches of Napoleon's exploits,
from the time he was "le petit corporal"
until he became the dethroned emperor;
and every possible episode in the life of
Napoleon the Third, concluding with a
large engraving of the Chislehurst exile
lying upon his pillow, the crafty, ambitious
face still and calm in the solemnity of
death. Then came a likeness or two of
Eugénie in her exquisite beauty, and a row
of portraits of the Prince Imperial, developing
from the somewhat plain, pugnacious-looking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_210' name='Page_210'>[210]</a></span>
boy, to the intelligent, spirited,
earnest face of the young soldier who fell
among the Zulus but yesterday.
</p>

<p>
Leaving the old woman, with her smiling
face and trembling limbs, standing in her
sunny porch surrounded by flowers in the
quiet little court, and emerging into the
noisy street, we seemed to return, with an
effort, from the romance of the old empire
to the prose of modern life.
</p>

<p>
Another little property, formerly belonging
to the Buonapartes, lies at the end of
the Cours Grandval, beyond the hotel.
Here is the <span lang="fr_FR">"Grotte de Napoléon,"</span> a little
natural arbour or open cave formed by
granite boulders and shaded by ilex, where
the boy Napoleon used to study his lessons,
or arrange his mimic campaigns with his
companions.
</p>

<p>
It was formerly in the midst of a sheltered
garden, but a road now runs close beside
it; and this publicity destroys much of its
romance.
</p>

<p>
The road, a new, as it is a rough and
steep one, ascends for several miles, showing
a pretty bird's eye view of the town,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_211' name='Page_211'>[211]</a></span>
and by degrees revealing a panorama of
distant mountains in every direction, standing
in purple and snowy circles round the
greener, smaller hills.
</p>

<p>
It is a beautiful drive; and nothing can
well be more refreshing than to wind slowly
up the steep road, as we did on a breathlessly
hot day, out of the quivering heat of
Ajaccio, into the vast open hill scenery and
gradually freshening atmosphere. Gardens,
full of shady groves and tall fan palms, line
the way, occasionally marred by the defective
proportions of a family tomb.
</p>

<p>
Every road round Ajaccio, and, indeed,
round any considerable Corsican town, is
full of these family tombs, placed in private
grounds beside the highway; sometimes,
but rarely, picturesque in architecture and
embosomed in shade; but, more generally,
square and hideous, bearing, but for the
iron cross on the roof, a greater resemblance
to a bathing-machine than to aught else.
</p>

<p>
There appear to be few churchyards in
Corsica. Cemeteries there are, often beautifully
placed among cypress groves upon
the hill-side; but the greater proportion of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_212' name='Page_212'>[212]</a></span>
the well-to-do inhabitants prefer to bury
their dead in their own grounds.
</p>

<p>
A little tomb or chapel is erected over
the remains, generally large enough to hold
eight or ten people; and here, once a year,
on the anniversary of the death, the family
meet to hear Mass performed.
</p>

<p>
This road, called "la route de Salario,"
from a fountain further on, bearing that
name, was particularly unfortunate in the
style and position of its numerous tombs.
</p>

<p>
The least unsightly were the poorest. It
was touching, here and there in a little
wayside garden, to see, half hidden amongst
overgrowing herbage or creeping flowers,
a simple stone cross rising out of the
ground to mark where lay the remains of
the poor man or his child, whose days had
been spent in the cottage close by, surrounded
by that glorious amphitheatre of
hills.

<h2>
CHAPTER XVII.
<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">THE CHAPEL OF ST. ANTHONY.</span>
</h2>

<p>
There are not many excursions round
Ajaccio; but the Chapelle de Saint Antoine,
about seven miles off, is well worth a visit.
</p>

<p>
The road winds for five or six miles among
green hills and through ilex avenues to the
base of the slope, where you are obliged to
dismount and continue the rest of the way
on foot.
</p>

<p>
It is an exceedingly rutty and bad road,
although tolerably flat, and we did well in
providing ourselves with a little light open
carriage, drawn by a pair of energetic
ponies. In this vehicle we went jolting
along, more often in the air than on the
cushions, and getting decidedly more
exercise than would be useful or agreeable
to a winter invalid.
</p>

<p>
On the way we passed two pénitenciers,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_214' name='Page_214'>[214]</a></span>
or prisons, for French male culprits. Our
driver informed us, with what accuracy I
am not certain, that only French prisoners
are confined in Corsica, and that Corsican
delinquents are sent to the Continent to
work out their time. It was found that,
with the facilities of the universal maquis,
and the deeply rooted sympathies of their
own countrymen and women, escape for
these latter became too easy and too frequent
in their own country.
</p>

<p>
I fear, in that case, the poor Corsican
has made a bad exchange. These Ajaccio
pénitenciers have a very modified prison
air, and are apparently much less stern in
discipline than the Continental jails.
</p>

<p>
One of them was placed high up, some
distance from the road, upon the summit
of a steep hill, where the prisoners must
enjoy the purest of airs and the most
beautiful of views.
</p>

<p>
The other was close by the roadside. It
was a large white building, with barred
windows; but, in other respects, with little
of a prison look about it. Only a low wall
and open gates divided it from the high-road,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_215' name='Page_215'>[215]</a></span>
and handsome trees shaded the surrounding
courtyard.
</p>

<p>
It being Sunday when we passed, few of
the men were at work; and several were
standing idly in the courtyard, with a
strangely independent and comfortable air.
A warder was certainly with them, but he
had an unobtrusive manner, and appeared
to be unarmed. The men were dressed in
quiet brown suits, which, to a stranger's
eye, had little of the convict cut; and, but
for the evil expression on some of the dark
faces that scowled at us over the wall, it
would have been difficult to realize the fact
that these were robbers and murderers.
</p>

<p>
Fresh from a visit to Portland, with its
high stony walls, its enclosed and guarded
outlets, and its separate small gangs, each
with an athletic warder with ever-watchful
eye and loaded gun, the contrast of this
French-Corsican prison, with its open portals
and happy-go-lucky air of nonchalance,
struck me forcibly.
</p>

<p>
Soon after passing the pénitencier, the
carriage, with a final jolt, stopped at the
foot of the green slope, and we got out to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_216' name='Page_216'>[216]</a></span>
pursue the narrow winding track, passing
among macchie-covered sand-hills, and
mounting steeply towards the rocks beyond.
It was hot work, for there was no shade,
and the sand burnt beneath our feet, and
the rocks glowed before us; but the cystus
gave out a refreshing scent, and at every
turn the grey walls grew taller and more
rugged and imposing, as the green mounds
in front cleared away.
</p>

<p>
About half-way to the chapel, we fell in
with some <span lang="fr_FR"><i>bergère</i></span> women, bringing supplies
to their lords upon the mountain side, from
the town of Ajaccio. There were three of
them, and they were certainly as rough
and wild, and unfeminine-looking as the
wives of the bergers are usually reported
to be.
</p>

<p>
They had flung down their bundles, and
were lying on the banks of cystus, playing
with a dirty pack of cards, with more merriment
than refinement. They favoured us
with a good deal of notice as we passed; and,
when No. 1 addressed a good-natured greeting
to them, notwithstanding their scanty
knowledge of the French language, were not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_217' name='Page_217'>[217]</a></span>
slow to respond, and to pursue us with much
chaff.
</p>

<p>
A few more turns brought us to the foot
of the splendid rocks, and to the wide open
plain, on which stands the little chapel of
St. Anthony. The chapel itself is a queer
little building, dirty and unpretending, the
size of a small cottage, and possessing the
odour of a pig-sty, with only one window
and a wooden door.
</p>

<p>
Climbing on the step below this window
and peering in, we saw a low, mean-looking
room, with a few common wooden benches
in it, and a small altar at the end, surmounted
by an insignificant picture. An
iron cross was placed on the west end of the
little edifice, which otherwise might have
been taken for a cow-shed.
</p>

<p>
Two or three hundred yards from the
chapel, and just at the foot of the rocks,
was a small cottage, uninviting and unclean-looking;
but, saving for this, a grand
solitude reigned over this most wild and
picturesque spot.
</p>

<p>
The plain, or rather valley (for high hills
mount guard on either side), runs some distance
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_218' name='Page_218'>[218]</a></span>
out towards the sea, which beats
angrily at the foot of the cliffs which
abruptly break its course.
</p>

<p>
The rocks facing the north are the
grandest imaginable. Several hundred feet
high, and composed of magnificent grey
granite boulders, they rise, with jagged and
serrated points, into the blue sky in two
almost perpendicular ridges.
</p>

<p>
Maquis clings to the lower crags and
fir-trees to the higher, and little paths,
made by the sheep, and steep as ladders,
wind confusingly in and out among hollowed
and grotesque rocks.
</p>

<p>
Round about the cottage were two or
three little gardens, fenced in with wattles
to a height of six feet, to keep out the
destructive goats, and giving the appearance
of African kraals.
</p>

<p>
Nos. 1 and 3 were still sketching the
little chapel, and No. 2 sitting upon a furze
bush in silent reflection, when our card-playing
friends reappeared round the corner
of the sand-hills. Laying down their burdens
on a knoll close beside the chapel,
they proceeded to put their fingers in their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_219' name='Page_219'>[219]</a></span>
mouths and give a series of shrill whistles,
which echoed among the rocks.
</p>

<p>
The call was soon answered from the
heights, and presently, bounding down the
steep hill-side, came three of the wildest
and roughest human animals of the male
species it is possible to picture.
</p>

<p>
There was little doubt about the purpose
of their meeting, as men and women reclined
upon the grassy bank, and set to, with
hearty good will, at their <i>al fresco</i> repast,
cracking noisy jokes, and retailing rapid
gossip to each other.
</p>

<p>
They were rather a cut-throat looking
party; and when, half an hour afterwards,
No. 1, who had departed a little distance
for another sketch, could not be found for
some minutes, a horrid qualm, having
reference to brigands, vendetta knives, and
deep gorges, came over Nos. 2 and 3 with
unpleasant force.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding the heat of the day, and
the steepness of the paths, Nos. 2 and 3
determined to scale part of the rocky walls.
An old man, seated in a little enclosure,
like a spider in his web, and probably
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_220' name='Page_220'>[220]</a></span>
belonging to the cottage hard by, had
apparently some insuperable objection to
this proceeding, and rather startled the
weak nerves of No. 3, already a little upset,
by shouting after the pair in an undistinguishable
patois jargon, and following
them for some little distance. Their legs
were younger than his, however; and as he
got worsted in the chase the equanimity
of No. 3 was restored.
</p>

<p>
This part of the country is said to be
a favourite resort of the bandits, special
advantages being offered, in the inaccessible
rocks and hollow caverns, to the hardy
fugitive from the law.
</p>

<p>
Some of the boulders are so entirely
hollowed out as to resemble an egg-shell or
a woman's hood. They must have been
filled formerly with a softer substance,
which, by degrees, has been worn away by
rain and frost, leaving the harder coating
of granite, sometimes only an inch or two
thick.
</p>

<p>
As we mounted slowly up the little rocky
winding path, pushing our way through
thick growing shrubs, and hid from each
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_221' name='Page_221'>[221]</a></span>
other at every turn, one felt that nothing
could well be more appropriate to the scene
than the appearance, from behind any
boulder, or at the entrance of any of these
stony egg-shells, of a black-bearded, eagle-eyed
man, gun in hand and pistol in belt.
A bandit seemed the natural appendage of
such surroundings; but he appeared not.
</p>

<p>
Nothing was to be seen except sky, and
rock, and hill, as we gained the summit of
the first ledge, and, wiping our fevered
brows, sat down to rest; whilst far, far
below, almost out of sight, fled and tumbled
a little stream, gurgling away to the plain
with a cool, inviting murmur; and from
enormous distances echoed the wild calls of
shepherd boys and men, far apart and far
away among the rocks, sounding weird and
unlike anything human across the stillness
and the wide solitude.
</p>

<p>
Hurrying down again after a short rest,
to see if No. 1 had, during our two hours'
absence, fallen into a chasm or been kidnapped
by bandits, we found her somewhat
nervous at our lengthened stay, but otherwise
uninjured, surrounded by a group of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_222' name='Page_222'>[222]</a></span>
dark-eyed, wild-looking maidens and children,
whom she had arrested in their work of
gathering sticks among the maquis, and
was hastily transferring with skilful pencil
to her sketch-book.
</p>

<p>
These barefooted, picturesque girls evidently
came from some shepherd hut buried
amongst the rocky wilds around. They
were an amusing mixture of shyness and
merriment. At first, pulling their white
handkerchiefs well over their sunburnt faces,
they turned away giggling, silently refusing
to be pourtrayed, without however the least
understanding what the process was; but
presently, becoming bolder, they consented
to turn their faces towards us and make
some effort at standing still. They could
not, of course, speak a word of French, and
their patois was so strong that they could
not even understand No. 1's grammatical
Italian, nor make their answers comprehensible
to her. When the portraits were
finished and shown to them, being the first
drawing they had ever seen, they could not
for some time make out the meaning of the
cabalistic marks; but, when at last it was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_223' name='Page_223'>[223]</a></span>
explained to them that these were intended
to represent themselves, they laughed long
and loudly.
</p>

<p>
But, what with bandit caves and shepherd
maidens, time slipped away rapidly; and a
glance at our watches suddenly showed us
that it was now nearly five o'clock, dinner
being at six; and we began a hasty retreat
to the carriage, spurred on, over the sandy,
rutty path, by the mundane reflection, that,
unless we could do our seven miles in something
like an hour, we stood a chance of
going to bed supperless.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_224' name='Page_224'>[224]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
CHAPTER XVIII.
<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">LES ILES SANGUINAIRES.</span>
</h2>

<p>
Another pleasant excursion and drive from
Ajaccio is to the Iles Sanguinaires, about nine
miles' distance. A good bye-road has been
made to this place, flat and sandy, and
following the edge of the Mediterranean the
whole way.
</p>

<p>
The islands lie to the south-west of the
town, and probably owe their title to their
dangerous position.
</p>

<p>
St. Nicodemus appears, for some reason
(certainly not, one would think, from the
natural timidity and vacillation of his character,
so foreign to theirs), to be a favourite
amongst the Corsicans; for here again, just
outside the town, upon the sea-shore itself,
we found a little tabernacle, about six feet
high, erected to his memory. It was open
in front, with a wire covering, and contained
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_225' name='Page_225'>[225]</a></span>
two figures, one apparently representing a
dead person, being supported on the knees
of the other, probably intended for our Lord
and the Saint.
</p>

<p>
For two or three miles outside Ajaccio,
the road, on the land side, was bordered
without intermission with a succession of
little green enclosures, each containing a
small square building placed in the centre.
These are the tombs of all the principal
families of Ajaccio. They differ in size and
in shape, but all have an iron cross upon
the roof, and almost all are ugly.
</p>

<p>
This was not the case everywhere. At
Sartene I saw some pretty and picturesque
tombs; but none here.
</p>

<p>
As we left the tombs behind us, steep hills
began to rise from the road, some green
with maquis, and some clothed in grey
rocks, where however the asphodel and the
universal cystus clung with a loving tenacity
here and there.
</p>

<p>
The prickly pear, too, which loves the
very edge of the sea, and abounds near
Bastia and Ajaccio, grew in thick rough
hedges along the roadside, covered with its
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_226' name='Page_226'>[226]</a></span>
little reddish pear-like fruit, which was
beginning to ripen. This fruit is much
eaten by the poorer Corsicans, who say it is
very pleasant. It is ripe about July; and
as nearly every hill and sandy wayside
near the coast is more or less covered with
the uncouth-looking tropical plant, its fruit
must be a great boon to the very poor, and
to the passing wayfarer.
</p>

<p>
We reached the Iles Sanguinaires in a
little more than an hour and a half; and,
drawing up, the driver immediately turned
the horses across the road, and flung himself,
face downwards, upon the grass in the
sun to sleep, whilst we wandered on to the
promontory before us.
</p>

<p>
It is a high conical hill, joined to the
mainland and road by only a narrow strip of
land, and looks, at a little distance, like
another island. On its summit is a Genoese
round watch-tower, very little ruined. The
entrance (if ever there was one to this
tower) is now choked up by sand and soil
and pebbles; and the one square window
is about eight feet from the ground, so we
could not peep inside; but the window
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_227' name='Page_227'>[227]</a></span>
showed us the massive proportions, more
than a yard thick, which, in company with
so many others in the island, have stood on
their stormy eminence facing two seas, and
defying the attacks of winds and foul
weathers as well as foes. The hill was
almost covered with a beautiful, mauve-coloured,
low-growing flower, something like
an English stock, and of a star shape, with
a white centre. Between the shrubs, too,
and upon the grass and flowers, lay scattered
hundreds of lovely echinæ, three or four
inches in diameter, with spikes an inch long
of a rich purple, crimson, or brown. They
were all broken in half, and tenantless; but
not otherwise injured by the violence of the
wind which blew them up to this grassy
height.
</p>

<p>
The islands, three principal ones, and
some lesser, lay scattered out to sea beyond
the hill; the nearest perhaps not more than
a quarter of a mile off; and, between them
and the mainland, ran a fierce current.
</p>

<p>
They were very picturesque, as they lay,
one behind the other, each with its warning
lighthouse perched on its rocky summit.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_228' name='Page_228'>[228]</a></span>
The largest was several miles in length, and
had soft green patches mingling with the
cold grey of its granite walls. But, even
to-day, under a cloudless blue sky and calm
still atmosphere, the white surf beat against
the steep sides; and, as the sun sank lower
towards the horizon, a blood-red hue crept
over the rough, jagged island heads, which
suggested another and more literal meaning
for their appellation of the Bloody Islands.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_229' name='Page_229'>[229]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
CHAPTER XIX.
<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">JOURS DE FÊTE AT AJACCIO.</span>
</h2>

<p>
The 10th, 11th, and 12th of May were
grand days at Ajaccio; regattas going on
the first two days, and horse races on the
third. For some days beforehand preparations
were being made, triumphal arches
put up, and posts hung with Chinese
lanterns. For once, the Corsican natives
seemed to wake up, and an unwonted
number of men were to be seen, in their
excitement standing upright, instead of
lounging before their doors or lying asleep
upon the quay.
</p>

<p>
Saturday, the first day of the regatta, was
rather a failure, owing to the weather. It
was a gloomy chilly day, raining a good
deal in the morning.
</p>

<p>
In the afternoon, however, it cleared up
partially, and we strolled out under a grey
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_230' name='Page_230'>[230]</a></span>
sky towards the harbour. The <i>Agincourt</i>
lay in the offing, sent by the English
Government as a compliment to the French;
and also a large American vessel, as well as
some handsome steamers.
</p>

<p>
Leaving the crowd upon the quay, we
climbed out upon the masses of great white
stone, which just now constitute the remains
of the pier. It shows the force of the waves,
even here in this sheltered corner of the
bay, that, a few months ago, during a
sudden storm, these enormous masses were
broken up and thrown one upon another
by the furious waters, like wooden blocks
heaped up by a child.
</p>

<p>
It was exciting work climbing upon these
blocks, and looking down upon the bright
emerald water and white surface rolling
under our feet, or playing at catch-me-who-can
with the advancing and retreating
waves; but, as far as the regatta went, the
scene was as dull and unenlivening as
possible; and two or three sailing vessels
appeared to represent the competitors.
Half an hour of this was quite sufficient,
and we returned to our hotel, feeling that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_231' name='Page_231'>[231]</a></span>
foreign regattas were just as much a slow
and stupid pastime as they usually are in
England.
</p>

<p>
The next day's proceedings, however,
were much livelier.
</p>

<p>
We did not care to see more of the marine
amusements, so, after morning church, spent
the afternoon in a lovely drive, reserving
the evening for dissipation.
</p>

<p>
At this time of the year the season is
over, and the pretty little English church,
raised during the last few years through the
personal energy and generosity of a Scotch
lady, is usually closed. This it had been
for two or three Sundays before our arrival,
since the chaplain had departed; but this
Sunday we had the unusual good fortune of a
choice between two services&mdash;one on board
the <i>Agincourt</i>, to which the officers kindly
invited us, and one in the little church
itself.
</p>

<p>
With a strong desire to attend both at
the same time, we finally decided on the
church at our gates, feeling it a duty not
to lessen the small congregation expected
there, and perhaps a little comforted by the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_232' name='Page_232'>[232]</a></span>
heavy swell that reigned in the bay, and
which might possibly affect the deck of the
<i>Agincourt</i>.
</p>

<p>
So we made three of the little congregation
of fifteen, where the chaplain of the
winter before last (who happened to be on
a visit) read prayers; and Dr. Prothero,
queen's preacher (on board a yacht in the
harbour), preached a beautiful sermon on
the text, "Master, we have toiled all the
night, and have taken nothing." We were
not even devoid of music, owing to the
kind offer of a young Englishman stopping
at the hotel, whose harmonium strains
we all followed to the best of our fifteen
abilities.
</p>

<p>
Dinner was a very merry one in the hotel
that evening. About eight of the <i>Agincourt</i>
officers, accompanied by a noble colley dog,
joined our small party, and added a good
deal to our sociability. In honour of them
we had quite a genteel spread, and generous
allowance of nuts and oranges, some of
which served to seduce the Ajaccio street
gamins, peering curiously in at the open
window, into a condition of excitement
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_233' name='Page_233'>[233]</a></span>
which resulted in the well-merited reproof
of cold pig, administered unseen from an
upper window&mdash;and in their consequent
flight.
</p>

<p>
The whole town was <span lang="fr_FR"><i>en fête</i></span> to-night,
and at eight o'clock we went out to see
the fun. Fun it certainly was; the entire
population out and enjoying itself noisily;
but, apparently, no one rough or tipsy or
disorderly.
</p>

<p>
Most of the principal buildings were
illuminated; whilst the town presented
quite a fairy-like appearance. Down all
the principal streets, there was a continuous
succession of large Chinese lanterns,
hung from posts about eight feet high; and
nothing could well have been prettier than
this uninterrupted line of hundreds of
golden balls, scarcely swaying in the still
evening air.
</p>

<p>
The Hôtel de Ville, close by the quay,
appeared to be the centre of excitement,
and here a thousand or two of people,
chiefly men, shouted and hurrahed, jostling
each other good-humouredly, and without
fear of pickpockets.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_234' name='Page_234'>[234]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
It was pleasant for once to see the popular
apathy in abeyance.
</p>

<p>
The light which streamed from the illuminations
on the houses round lit up the
large open square with its seething mass of
humanity into picturesque groups, showing
here a black velveteened Corsican with a
white kerchiefed companion, there a French
soldier in bright uniform, and, further on,
two grinning, good-tempered British tars,
as shiningly clean and as much at their
ease as they have a habit of looking all over
the globe.
</p>

<p>
A little higher up, it fell, with a fainter
radiance, upon Napoleon's grave features in
the Place du Marché, turning the numerous
fountain jets around him into rainbow
arches of fairy-like tracery.
</p>

<p>
We had not been long on the quay before
the shouting redoubled, and the crowd,
falling back with some difficulty, made
room for a procession to pass out from the
Hôtel de Ville.
</p>

<p>
A tremendous tattoo was heard, and out
came a band with a prodigious number of
drums, every one of which was made to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_235' name='Page_235'>[235]</a></span>
exert itself to the fullest extent of its parchment
lungs. It was preceded by a large
flag, vociferously applauded, and which,
doubtless, was the national flag, and followed
by a troop of soldiers bearing aloft
Chinese lanterns or flaming torches fastened
upon poles.
</p>

<p>
Forming upon the Place outside, they
started off on the tour of the town, followed
by most of the populace; and the great
square became deserted. For the next
hour it was very pretty to see them, as, at
some break in the streets or sudden turn,
the golden lamps and torches came into
sight in the distance, winding in and out,
and moving slowly on, followed by the roll
of drums and the shouting crowds.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, we strolled up and down the
quay, close beside the edge of the water,
waiting for the electric light which had
been promised from the deck of the <i>Agincourt</i>,
and which was our national quota
contributed to the night's amusement. All
afternoon the English nation had been
"doing the civil" in honour of the occasion,
which was said to be the first on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_236' name='Page_236'>[236]</a></span>
which a British man-of-war had appeared
upon the Corsican coasts out of compliment,
and not for <i>business</i>. Tribes of
residents had visited the ship, and been
introduced to the captain's cabin, where
fraternity had been sworn between French
and English, and sealed with champagne.
</p>

<p>
It was a beautiful evening for the electric
light; calm and still, and so dark, that it
was with some difficulty we managed to
escape falling over the unprotected sides of
the quay, and thus meeting a watery grave.
</p>

<p>
At first it burnt simply as a bright star
upon the deck of the <i>Agincourt</i>; then,
moving swiftly round, it turned a stream
of light, clearer than day, upon the distant
horizon, lighting up sailing boats upon the
far-off line; then again, piercing the utter
darkness to one side, it suddenly brought
a fishing smack, at anchor in the harbour
a furlong or so off, into closest contiguity,
showing every rope upon its yards, every
man on deck, in clearest detail.
</p>

<p>
Then, with mysterious, stealthy movement,
flitting on, it turned abruptly towards
the quay, and a shout of delight broke from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_237' name='Page_237'>[237]</a></span>
the spectators, as the houses round shone
in the glare of day, and the faces of the
crowd stood out for a few minutes in unnatural
clearness.
</p>

<p>
There was something appallingly, horribly
perfect about the management of the light;
and one felt almost sorry for the foe whose
little night man&oelig;uvres would be rendered
entirely hopeless by such an invention.
</p>

<p>
The light played about for more than an
hour, and then faded slowly away; and we
returned to our hotel while still the crowds
were shouting and amusing themselves, but
with some of the hanging lanterns already
beginning to take fire in the deserted Cours
Grandval, and drop unnoticed on to the
darkening pathway.
</p>

<p>
The nest day, Monday, this same Cours
was to be the scene of another wild excitement.
</p>

<p>
The horse races are always held up this
road, which is hard and not too good, and
terminates in a steep hill.
</p>

<p>
Every evening, about six o'clock, for
some weeks, the practising for these races
had been going on; and consisted generally
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_238' name='Page_238'>[238]</a></span>
of four or five raw-boned horses with long
striding paces, ridden by rather ragged
jockeys, sans saddle, and with reins held
well up in the air.
</p>

<p>
This did not promise great things for the
eventful day; but perhaps the races turned
out better than appearances warranted.
</p>

<p>
We saw nothing of them; for, after a
breakfast at 6 a.m., and a farewell to a dear
canine friend called Chivey, we started off
that very morning for a week's tour to the
forest of Bavella.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_239' name='Page_239'>[239]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
CHAPTER XX.
<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">A RAW LUNCH.</span>
</h2>

<p>
It was a lovely sunny morning when we
three, in high spirits, set out on our expedition
to the forest of Bavella, and the
south of the island.
</p>

<p>
Our open carriage was exceedingly comfortable,
with a hood in case of bad weather;
the bay horses went well, and the coachman
appeared irreproachable.
</p>

<p>
There is no feeling in the world so exhilarating
and delicious as that experienced
in starting off on a Bohemian tour, without
luggage, without responsibilities, unhampered
by fear of railway time-tables or
the care of boxes, dawdling or hurrying at
will, starting at what hour one pleases, and
out all day in the fresh mountain air, with
<i>al fresco</i> meals and a turf siesta. It is the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_240' name='Page_240'>[240]</a></span>
gipsy's life, robbed of its discomforts, but
not of its primitive ease and romance.
</p>

<p>
As we rolled round the circular bay, and
up the winding ascent on the further side,
the water sparkled calmly in the glassy mist
of morning sunshine, and the <i>Agincourt</i> lay
with deserted deck, like a "painted ship
upon a painted ocean."
</p>

<p>
But the road leading to the town was
already all astir with country people coming
in for the races; and, further on, higher up
the hill, as the pretty white houses of
Ajaccio on their spit of land grew less and
less distinct against the blue Mediterranean,
we met with more and more of these.
</p>

<p>
Men and women, all on muleback, and all
seated astride&mdash;sometimes two men, or a
woman and boy on one animal&mdash;the men
with their gun behind their shoulder, and
their red gourd slung by their side,&mdash;were
driving strings of cows, horses, and foals
before them, for the fair which was to be
held that morning prior to the races.
</p>

<p>
All the men lifted their caps politely; but
some of the animals objected strongly to us
and our carriage, and could scarcely be got
to pass us.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_241' name='Page_241'>[241]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
We soon passed away from the sea-coast
and the sea views, and entered the inland
country, among green hills, and past a
broad river, with blue and snow-streaked
mountains rising up before us.
</p>

<p>
Presently approaching the village of Cauro
or Cavro, where we changed horses, the
mountain of Bastelica stood out in unrivalled
grandeur of white cone above us;
and as we slowly ascended the steep road
in the exquisite freshness of morning, the
birds sang loudly and continuously from
the banks of white cystus which covered
the lower parts of the wooded slopes lining
the road.
</p>

<p>
Though so early, it was almost too hot to
walk; and when we reached Cauro, the
horses were in a bath of perspiration.
</p>

<p>
From Ajaccio to Cauro and Bastelica is a
favourite excursion; but it is a very long
and fatiguing one for one day, and Cauro
does not look a tempting place for a night's
rest.
</p>

<p>
As we left Cauro and continued our steep
ascent, the mountains grew grander, and
the trees increased. Maquis of the most
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_242' name='Page_242'>[242]</a></span>
delicious sort followed the roadside, and
the air was laden with the strong scent of
the tall Mediterranean heath, which fought
with arbutus and cystus for the foremost
place, whilst cyclamen, golden bloom, and
hellebore clustered at their feet.
</p>

<p>
Here we met some women whose costume
astonished us considerably. Their white
handkerchiefs were closely wrapped about
their faces as well as heads, in Mohammedan
fashion, covering up all their features, and
leaving only the eyes visible. They appeared
to be on their way to Ajaccio, and were
driving a few cows before them; but it
seemed more than probable that they would
be suffocated with heat before they got there.
On one other occasion, in the region of
Bastia, we met with some more women
dressed after the same uncomfortable
fashion, but failed to discover its meaning.
</p>

<p>
Up on the summit of the Col, overlooking
lovely views, was a most filthy, picturesque
village. Queer little balconies surrounded
half-ruined but inhabited houses, which
were approached from the sloping hill-side
by broken-down wooden bridges.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_243' name='Page_243'>[243]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Stalking about in front of one of them,
was a dignified and majestic-looking goat,
enormously large, as are many of the Corsican
goats, and of a peculiar piebald&mdash;pure
white up to the shoulders, and jet black
over head and neck. He seemed to hold
the porcine and canine companions (who,
with him, had evidently the right of entry
into most of the houses) in supreme contempt;
and it was a marvel to me how he
had preserved the cleanly whiteness of his
long hair&mdash;for the small specimens of ragged
humanity who sat upon the dung-heaps
close by, or swarmed noisily after the
carriage, were so encrusted with dirt as
to leave their original colour a matter of
speculation.
</p>

<p>
But we did not pause long in this unsavoury
village. We were soon through
its one little street, dashing down&mdash;through
green hills, and by falling streams with
trees overhead, with a succession of exquisite
mountain ranges, one layer behind the
other, lying before us&mdash;to the cleaner village
of Grosseto.
</p>

<p>
From Grosseto to Bechisano&mdash;a hamlet
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_244' name='Page_244'>[244]</a></span>
of some size, where we were to make the
mid-day halt&mdash;the views were most lovely.
For miles we wound above a verdant gorge,
grassy broken hills on either side, and grey
moss-covered rocky cliffs rising immediately
beneath us from the bed of a foaming
boulder-strewn river, sometimes hidden by
the bending trees which caressed its rapid
stream.
</p>

<p>
From the pretty stone bridge of two
uneven arches which presently spanned this
river, a beautiful view was obtained of
winding waters, green tufted rocks and
background of jagged blue mountain tops.
Every turn was a richer study for an artist,
and Nos. 1 and 3 lived in a constant frenzy
of effort to secure a sketch, under the unfavourable
conditions of a rapidly descending
carriage, and two minutes of time allowed.
</p>

<p>
The irritation became a little less when
once more we commenced ascending towards
Bechisano; but the sky was now growing
heavy and ominous with dark blue clouds,
and the shade cast over us by a great hill&mdash;covered
from top to bottom with ilex-trees,
some hoary and grey with age, but for the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_245' name='Page_245'>[245]</a></span>
most part shining in their rich young green
with golden shoots&mdash;was no longer welcome,
but depressing and gloomy.
</p>

<p>
Close to Bechisano, and exactly as we
reached the summit of the Col San Georgio,
the storm burst upon us. It had been
raining more and more heavily for some
time, when suddenly, without a previous
rumble of any kind, came a vivid flash of
lightning that blinded us, accompanied
instantaneously by a crash of thunder like
the firing of artillery.
</p>

<p>
After that storm, I never felt a moment's
suspicion of Corsican horses.
</p>

<p>
We were creeping up the hill, the driver
walking beside them; and although he put
out his hand and silently clutched the reins,
the jump they gave was almost imperceptible.
As for him, he never turned a
hair, but continued his silent reflective
walk with the same equanimity, whilst the
lightning flashed about him playfully, and
spouts of rain poured down from his wide-awake
hat.
</p>

<p>
The next hour was spent in a vain
endeavour to keep out the driving sheets of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_246' name='Page_246'>[246]</a></span>
rain which made all nature a blurred blot
around us; and when we got out at
Bechisano our feet were in a pool an inch
or two deep, and our shawls made running
streams over the floor of the dirty little inn.
This inn was a wretched welcome, even for
travellers so drowned and depressed as we
were. There was a better one about half
a mile further on, at the other end of the
village; but, through some mistake, for
which he afterwards deeply reproached himself,
our driver halted here.
</p>

<p>
The little broken glass door led into two
very small rooms, one opening out of the
other, both stone floored; with one or two
apologies for chairs, and a greasy table in
the first room. This apartment had no
fireplace; so necessity forced us to take
refuge in the inner one, where a few sticks
burnt upon the hearth, and where the family
of four or five men and women, a dog, and
a due proportion of babies, were huddled
together, but they politely endeavoured to
make room for us and our steaming garments.
It was difficult not to stumble over the
smaller fry, as the tiny room appeared to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_247' name='Page_247'>[247]</a></span>
have no window, and was only partially lit
up by gleams from the wood fire.
</p>

<p>
Logs, however, were piled up for our
benefit; and as we made a feeble effort to
dry our soaked feet, a cheerful maiden prepared
our mid-day meal in the next room.
</p>

<p>
The floor of this room was in such a
condition, that, when we entered and took
our places beside the round table, we kept
our eyes carefully turned heavenward, for fear
of losing our appetites. We need not have
feared, however, for there was nothing to eat.
</p>

<p>
Raw ham, with a steel fork sticking in it,
was first offered to us; and when we
declined that, then raw fish, and afterwards
some third dish, likewise raw, of what
nature I forget. We were hungry, and
began to be desperate.
</p>

<p>
"Could nothing cooked be had?" inquired
No. 3. "For the English do not eat
their food uncooked."
</p>

<p>
The woman looked amazed and perplexed.
<span lang="fr_FR">"Mais non?"</span> she asked, incredulously, as
we pushed away the unpalatable dishes.
</p>

<p>
But our relief was great when it turned
out that the inn boasted a small leg of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_248' name='Page_248'>[248]</a></span>
mutton, which could at once be got ready
for us. This was done by placing the meat
upon a charred log, with a dish beneath,
and dropping lard upon it. When roasted,
it was more like a rabbit leg than a mutton
leg, but was not bad, and, together with a
very good omelette, soon disappeared, to
the relief of our famine.
</p>

<p>
There are but two things which it is safe
to order for lunch in these third-rate Corsican
inns, and which are invariably eatable and
good&mdash;omelette and broccia.
</p>

<p>
One of the queerest anomalies in Corsica
are the perfectly clean dinner napkins, with
which you are invariably supplied in the
poorest inns; and which contrast with the
total absence of tea-spoons and saucers at
breakfast, and the appearance of the dirty
two-pronged forks at dinner.
</p>

<p>
The old man, to whom the establishment
belonged, assisted at our lunch, and was
delighted to air his French, which, like his
daughter's, seemed to consist of a capacity
of saying half a dozen words, and not understanding
one.
</p>

<p>
Conversation, under these circumstances,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_249' name='Page_249'>[249]</a></span>
with the most polite intentions, became
somewhat embarrassing; and pleasing diversions
were caused by the entrance of a
blind man, led in to the fireside in the inner
room, and the occasional onslaughts made
by mine host upon the juvenile inquirers,
who, regardless of the pouring rain, pressed
their wet noses persistently against the
panes of the glass door, to obtain a glimpse
of the Inglese.
</p>

<p>
They had their reward when, shortly
afterwards, the carriage came round again,
and we packed ourselves in, amid an
admiring crowd.
</p>

<p>
It was still raining, but not so heavily,
and there was no possibility of a recurrence
of the pond beneath our feet, as our driver
had bored three little holes in the flooring
of the carriage to act as drainers.
</p>

<p>
From Bechisano to Propriano, a drive of
about four hours, the road is one continual
descent through steep rocky hills of picturesque
form; some covered with shrubs,
and some with trees, and often overhanging
the road as it winds by the edge of the
precipice.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_250' name='Page_250'>[250]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Not far from Bechisano we passed a
great boulder, hanging over the road and
supported by two or three tiny ones, reminding
one of a huge cromlech. Near
to it spread a many-tongued waterfall,
spanned by a stone bridge, from under
which it poured its heavy volume of water
into the gorge beneath.
</p>

<p>
Ilex and great hedges of Mediterranean
heath grew by the roadside; and, as we
approached the large village of Olmeto, and
the hills opened out a little, a superb panorama
of mountains rose behind us.
</p>

<p>
Olmeto is a gloomy-looking village,
perched half-way up the mountain side
ascending from before Propriano.
</p>

<p>
It has something forbidding about its
aspect, and gave one a shudder as one
passed through. The houses are filthy, and
many of them lie in untouched ruins, with
here and there a half-broken balcony, and,
much more rarely, an unbroken window;
and the men who stand and slouch at the
street corners have a dark, inhospitable,
hang-dog look about them, which is no
improvement upon the usual national expression,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_251' name='Page_251'>[251]</a></span>
half contemptuous, half good-natured,
of lethargic pride.
</p>

<p>
Olmeto and the neighbouring village of
Olio have both an exceedingly bad reputation.
</p>

<p>
The men out-Herod Herod in idleness,
even for Corsicans; and nearly every man
carries his gun and pistol, even to patrol
the village street. Two or three murders
occur every year in Olmeto alone; and the
only wonder is that the number is not
greater.
</p>

<p>
The vendetta is of course very strong at
Olmeto; and altogether, it must be an
uncomfortable place to live in.
</p>

<p>
No women at all were visible in the
village, either on our passing through it on
our way to Propriano or on our return some
days later; the presumption being, that the
weaker but wiser sex were, Corsican fashion,
making up in some degree for the dangerous
idleness of their lords by their own household
industry.
</p>

<p>
Coming back to Ajaccio by this same
route, our driver pointed out to me, near
the Col San Georgio, about half-way between
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_252' name='Page_252'>[252]</a></span>
Bechisano and Olmeto, a little maquis-covered
hill by the lonely roadside.
</p>

<p>
There, he said, among the thick shrubs,
about a year ago, a man concealed himself
to lay wait for a passing gendarme.
</p>

<p>
This man's father had been a bandit,
whom, in the performance of his duty,
years ago, the gendarme had shot.
</p>

<p>
Upon the bandit's death, his son had
taken to the hills, vowing vengeance upon
his father's murderer.
</p>

<p>
For years he had waited patiently for his
victim, until this day, when he knew he
must pass by alone.
</p>

<p>
Shot after shot pursued the gendarme
from his hidden foe, until at length one
pierced his neck, and laid him stiff upon
the grass, where his dead body was found
some time afterwards by a passer-by.
</p>

<p>
Tombs were scattered along the roadside
beyond Olmeto here and there; and an
avenue of young trees was planted for some
way down the descent. The mountains
were magnificent; and before us rose a
peculiar, high, conical hill, rearing itself
abruptly from the gorge, surmounted by a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_253' name='Page_253'>[253]</a></span>
crag which bore the most extraordinary
likeness to a ruined castle.
</p>

<p>
Peeps of blue sea shone out at our feet
as we went lower and lower; and presently,
turning a corner, the full wide
sweep of the Gulf of Valinco, glittering in
evening sunshine, opened out before us.
Heavy white surf lined the red shore, and
five or six good-sized charcoal vessels,
trading to Italy, lay in the harbour.
</p>

<p>
Propriano gleamed white and pretty just
above the sea, surrounded by its many little
bays, as we dashed down the hill-side,
through green country lanes, lined by wide
hedges of brilliant purple vetch and ponderous
prickly pear. Then, reaching the plain,
we wound round the boggy, sandy shore,
and mounted into the little narrow street
of Propriano, full of shouting children and
grunting pigs, up to the door of the Hôtel
de France.
</p>

<p>
Very grand was the title of our inn, but
not so grand its exterior, nor the dirty little
staircase and ground floor. The upper
storey, however, showed us a clean, airy,
cheerful salle à manger, into which opened
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_254' name='Page_254'>[254]</a></span>
three little bedrooms of inviting appearance,
and apparently irreproachable cleanliness.
The muslin window curtains were crisp
and new, the floors were swept, and the
blankets, as well as the sheets, bore inspection.
The washing basins, too, were much
beyond the usual regulation size of a soup
plate.
</p>

<p>
Whilst the good and cheap dinner was
preparing, Nos. 2 and 3 took a turn up the
little town, and scrambled out upon the
sea-shore.
</p>

<p>
A lovely blood-red sunset showed off to
advantage the purple range of hills opposite,
with the Genoese tower at their furthest
point, and cast deep shadows over the Col
San Georgio, with its sparkling snow
neighbours, and Olmeto lying on its flanks
in sullen twilight. But it was impossible
to enjoy any view with a pursuing crowd of
yelling, mocking children at one's heels;
and the usual scourge cut short our walk.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_255' name='Page_255'>[255]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
CHAPTER XXI.
<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">BERGERS AND GAMINS.</span>
</h2>

<p>
The next morning was showery, but not
devoid of sun; and, leaving No. 1 to rest
in the hotel, Nos. 2 and 3 set out early for
a country walk.
</p>

<p>
Our first object was to escape our juvenile
foes; our second to get upon the sea-shore,
which, we had heard, was covered with
beautiful shells. We managed (it being
school time, and so a portion of the little
savages out of the way) to effect the first;
but the second was not so easy of attainment
as it sounded.
</p>

<p>
Everywhere, except just beneath the
town, the shore was surrounded by a ridge
of sand-hills, divided from the sea by broad,
boggy plains.
</p>

<p>
The rain that had fallen the last few
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_256' name='Page_256'>[256]</a></span>
days made us sink in over the tops of our
boots when we attempted to cross these
bogs. So, for some distance, we continued
skirting the sand-hills, and following a little
path, which presently led to a small running
stream.
</p>

<p>
As we were preparing to make our leap
over this, a voice suddenly arrested us.
</p>

<p>
"What! You don't know the country&mdash;you?
You two women must not go alone
among the hills!"
</p>

<p>
Looking up, we saw a young woman
standing in the stream before us, arms
akimbo, and contemplating us with disapproving
curiosity. Her face was brown
and pretty, with the brightest of coal-black
eyes and white teeth; her petticoats
were pinned up above her knees, and,
with her shapely arms covered with soapsuds,
and her brown legs planted firmly in
the rapid stream, she presented an artistic
appearance well worthy of the brush of a
Faed or a Nicol. Thee was something
audacious and determined, and yet straight-forward,
about the young woman's address
and appearance, which impressed us both.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_257' name='Page_257'>[257]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Why not?" we asked.
</p>

<p>
"But why!" she retorted, peremptorily.
"Do you know the country, then? But of
course you do not. Any one can see that
you are strangers!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," we admitted, "we are strangers.
But what then?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, well! If you knew the country,
you two would not dream of going about
like this by yourselves."
</p>

<p>
"But why not?" we persisted, vaguely
impressed by our companion's manner.
"Every one is good to us in Corsica. What
will harm us? What is there to frighten
us?"
</p>

<p>
The young woman spread out her hands
in amazement at our obstinacy. "What?
Well"&mdash;with a shrug&mdash;<span lang="fr_FR">"des chiens, et
des bergers!"</span>
</p>

<p>
Later on, we learnt to regard this threat
of <i>bergers</i> in somewhat the same light as
the Saracen babies did that of Richard
C&oelig;ur de Lion, according to tradition; but
at present we had scarcely imbibed that
morbid and not very well-founded dread,
and the response of our black-eyed friend
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_258' name='Page_258'>[258]</a></span>
did not inspire the terror she seemed to
expect in our breasts.
</p>

<p>
For a moment or two we debated, and
then, thanking the young woman for her
kindly meant advice, we sprang over the
stream and passed on, leaving her standing
staring after us with all her black eyes, her
hands still clasping her supple waist. We
had no reason to repent our resolution, as
we wandered amongst the sand-hills, winding
down a little overgrown path which
seemed to lead to a further bay.
</p>

<p>
Anything like the flowers which, for a
mile or so of our way, covered the hillocks
around us, I never saw or dreamt of before.
</p>

<p>
People talk of the beauties of rock and
mountain scenery in Corsica, and the wild
grandeur of its wide forests; but, to my
mind, the distinguishing beauty of Corsica
lies in its flowers.
</p>

<p>
Switzerland and Italy boast their rocks
and mountains, and colder lands their
forests; but neither Switzerland nor Italy,
nor, I believe, any other country in Europe,
can attempt to rival the flowers of Corsica
in richness of colouring and luxuriance of
growth.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_259' name='Page_259'>[259]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Here, as we worked our way through
interlacing shrubs, on each side of us
stretched a sea of blossoms, completely
hiding from sight both stalks and green
leaves. Sheets of pink and white cystus,
brilliant purple vetch everywhere scrambling
over them, scarlet, crimson, and pink
poppies, blue borage, Michaelmas daisies,
cyclamen, and what in England we call the
garden sweet-pea, together with a host of
other gorgeous floral dainties, massed and
tangled themselves together in a blaze of
beauty.
</p>

<p>
We had walked about three miles when a
muddy bog brought us to a sudden stop.
The bay still lay some distance from us, and
we now saw that a tolerably wide river ran
across the plain between it and us; so we
turned back, sadder and wiser, baulked once
more, but with our hands full of lovely
flowers.
</p>

<p>
Not a creature did we see on this dangerous
route, except one very ragged boy
who was tearing madly after a herd of cows
on the boggy plain beneath; but here and
there, in the distance, were wretched-looking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_260' name='Page_260'>[260]</a></span>
stone or mud hovels, belonging, no doubt,
to the dreaded bergers of whom we had
been warned. These shepherds, scattered
all over the country, among the hills and
lonely pastures, are, according to all accounts,
a very rough lot.
</p>

<p>
They live almost like wild beasts, and
appear to be half savage.
</p>

<p>
Their miserable hovels are generally without
window or chimney, and utterly destitute
of furniture, even sometimes of any
approach to a bed, or any cooking utensil.
</p>

<p>
Their clothes are in rags, and their food
consists chiefly of the milk, cheese, and
mutton they obtain from their flocks, with
the addition of sour bread. Their wives are
as wild and uncivilized as themselves; they
know little or nothing of religion, and their
children grow up utterly ignorant and uneducated.
</p>

<p>
I never heard of their robbing strangers;
but their rough lawlessness makes the more
civilized village women afraid to go amongst
them.
</p>

<p>
Returning to the village, we determined
to brave one of the boggy plains; and,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_261' name='Page_261'>[261]</a></span>
creeping along by the side of a hillock,
managed at last to reach the sea-shore
without much damage. The rocks, scattered
about the little bay on which we entered,
completely sheltered us from the village,
and looked picturesquely black with the
clear white foam dashing over them in the
occasional gleams of a stormy sun. Regardless
of the great blue-black curtain
darkening the hills before us and spreading
over half the sky, we flung ourselves, face
downwards, upon the sands, and commenced
an energetic search for shells.
</p>

<p>
The shore here was simply covered with
them; some small, some large, but all of
them lovely; especially the large Venus'
ear, or <i>Haliotis Tuberculata</i>, with bright
mother-of-pearl lining.
</p>

<p>
A brilliant flash and loud thunder-clap
roused us from our interesting occupation;
and, together with heavy rain, put an end
to the shell-gathering of No. 3, who fled
ignominiously homewards, leaving No. 2
still reclining in dignified persistency, regardless
of storm and rain, under the lowering
sky. It is a very great mistake to wear
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_262' name='Page_262'>[262]</a></span>
a billycock hat and a light-coloured ulster
in Corsica. They were the cause of much
persecution to poor No. 3.
</p>

<p>
When she reached the hotel, she was
dripping from head to foot, and a lively
thunder-storm was raging; but this was
not cause sufficient to depress the energy
of the infant islander, who (now, alas! let
forth from school), with many a hoot and
yell of triumph, pursued both her and No. 2&mdash;who
arrived in the same condition ten
minutes later&mdash;not only to the door of the
hotel, but half-way up the stone staircase.
</p>

<p>
I never felt safe on these occasions until
I had entered into my bedroom and locked
the door; as the bolder part of the troop
sometimes came to the very door of the
sitting-room upstairs: and I always felt an
affinity with the poor fox pursued by his
yelping pack of tormentors.
</p>

<p>
At length, emerging heated and indignant
from my retirement, "Why," asked I,
of the broad, good-humoured landlady, who,
with Italian head-gear and voluble tongue,
had just come upstairs, dispersing the
juveniles on her way&mdash;"Why are your
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_263' name='Page_263'>[263]</a></span>
Corsican children such fiends, and how do
they ever manage to grow up into such
respectable, civil men and women?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, mademoiselle," said she, "you
must forgive them; they are very rude;
but, voilà, they take you for men! At
least, they say you are women dressed up
in men's clothes. I heard them calling it
out on the stairs," she continued. "One
says, 'The tall one is a man!' and the other
says, 'They are both men. Don't you see
they have both men's hats, and men's
cloaks, and black pantaloons?'"
</p>

<p>
Alas for English fashions of 1879!
Ulsters, wideawakes, and tight black dresses
suited the spring climate of Corsica uncommonly
well; but not equally well the tastes
of the inhabitants.
